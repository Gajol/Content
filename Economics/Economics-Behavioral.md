## Program Outline

## **A history of behavioral economics and prospect theory**

- Analyze the evolution of economics from Classical economics (e.g., Adam Smith) to modern-day neo-classical economics and where behavioral economics started to flourish in this paradigm
- Understand the revolutionary inflection point that occurred at the end of the 1970s by the three fathers of behavioral economics to explain how psychology became part of the economic model of decision making
- Dissect what systematic bias is and learn about the most cited and ground-breaking behavioral economy theory: prospect theory
- Explore several examples of how prospect theory matters both in our personal lives and when running a business

## **Sophisticated choices and self-control**

- Explain the influence of intertemporal components in the choices we make and realize how they can provoke non-standard behavior (such as obesity, addictions, credit card usage and dependence, etc.)
- Formulate mathematical models that explain phenomena such as procrastination and overindulgence
- Visualize examples of how self-control problems can lead to bad decision making: as soon as you turn 18, you are much more likely to be tried as an adult and, yet, we do not see people ceasing committing crimes as soon as they turn 18. Why is this?
- Learn how to apply this knowledge in a way that modifies behavior and improves the health of your business or the people around you

## **Fairness**

- Compare the dichotomy between the standard rational economics assumption that humans are self-interested and the behavioral economics propositions explaining how and why humans are altruistic and care about giving to others.
- Articulate why thinking in financial terms and incentives might not always be a wise idea, and understand how fairness matters within economic marketplaces, and how fairness is compatible with running a business
- Analyze why and when it is socially accepted to charge fees or surcharges, and more generally, to equilibrate supply and demand using standard economic pricing mechanisms
- Learn the importance of social norms and pressure, reciprocity, and distributive vs procedural justice

## **The psychology of incentive**

- Discover through a Qualtrics-based exercise in experimentation and prediction what kind of motivational treatments work best in the short run in order to make someone execute a given task
- Realize that behavioral economics is only barely getting started when it comes to understanding motivation: what other approaches motivate people to make decisions?
- Think about how to create a company culture that is built on solid psychological principles

## **Biased belief**

- Recognize how information interventions over biased beliefs can modify mindsets and be potential sources of change and development of new standards in decision making
- Learn how nearly everyone exhibits common biases such as projection bias and the bias of winner’s curse
- Identify some of the most important biases, such as survivorship bias and overconfidence and learn how they influence business decision making

## **Inattention**

- Discover how our attention is limited and why this limited attention leads us to make important decision errors when our attention is drawn to some things but not others
- See how something as simple as failing to pay attention to certain digits of a number can dramatically change how certain economic markets function
- Learn how inattention works in a competitive market and how to grapple with the ethics of competing for consumer attention
- Learn the challenges and opportunities in addressing human rights abuses in cybertechnology

## **Discrimination**

- Measure and identify the sensitive topic of discrimination through five distinctive methods: audit studies, all-else-equal studies, own-group bias studies, correspondence studies and eliminating group cues in the decision-making process
- Learn how standard economics categorizes discrimination into one of two models: statistical discrimination and taste-based discrimination
- Become familiar with how psychology can deepen our understanding of how discrimination works and how we can combat it

## **Nudging**

- Become familiar with basic principles of good choice architecture and the way we can influence people’s behavior by nudging them into a good direction
- Discuss several examples of nudging such as putting numbers into context and smart engineering/design
- Detect examples of nudges and sludge (bad psychology, the exact opposite of nudging) in the real world and apply it to your business or career

**Overview**

The field of behavioral economics is now a widely explored area as it combines two fields: psychology and economics. Richard Thaler is widely regarded as the most significant contributor to the field, but other figures like psychologist Daniel Kahneman (who went on to receive a Nobel Prize in 2002) and cognitive psychologist Amos Tversky, were crucial to what we understand about behavioral economics today. These three figures are considered the “fathers of behavioral economics.”

**Kahneman and Tversky**

Kahneman and Tversky wrote several papers that undermined the ideas about human nature held by mainstream economics at the time. In 1979, Tversky and Kahneman developed the Prospect Theory, which in simple terms stated that our willingness to take risks is influenced by the context in which we are given the choices. According to the Nobel Prize Committee, before developing the Prospect Theory, Kahneman and Tversky started their research investigating contradictions and irregularities in human behavior and decision-making. Their experiments clearly showed that when someone is offered the same choice in two different ways, they can give contrasting answers. The Prospect Theory was the first step in our understanding of behavioral economics.

**Thaler**

Richard Thaler is considered the premier father of behavioral economics because he built off the work of these other two figures and expanded on the research already done by Tversky and Kahneman. Thaler’s exploration of behavioral economics was inspired by the work that Kahneman and Tversky did. Thaler was the 2017 recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for “incorporating psychologically realistic assumptions into analyses of economic decision-making.” The Nobel Prize Committee particularly praised Thaler for “his exploration of the consequences of limited rationality, social preferences, and lack of self-control, and showed how these human traits affect economic decisions.” However, in Thaler’s own words, “the greatest thing I did was show that even economic agents are human.”

Thaler explored how economic decision-making by individuals and institutions is influenced by natural human cognitive limitations and biases, among other factors. His findings refuted the assumption that individuals always act rationally and selfishly, something that most economists had accepted, as it served well when making predictive models. According to the Britannica Encyclopaedia, Thaler even explored the poor self-control people have regarding saving for retirement or reaching future financial goals. He explained that experiences in the present or near-future are perceived as more significant than those in the distant future. In simpler terms, many tend to focus on the present financial situation without planning for their future. 

**Conclusion**

These three monumental figures were truly incredible and contributed remarkable work to the field of economics. It is because of them that people are starting to understand how behavioral economics works. People are learning that it is possible to avoid common mistakes that stem from behavioral economics. We owe these fathers of behavioral economics a huge thank you.
