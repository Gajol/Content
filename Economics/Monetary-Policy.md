QE : Quantiative Easing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing

**Quantitative easing** (**QE**) is a [monetary policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy) action whereby a [central bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank) purchases predetermined amounts of [government bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_bond) or other [financial assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_asset) in order to stimulate economic activity.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing#cite_note-1) Quantitative easing is a novel form of monetary policy that came into wide application after the [financial crisis of 2007-2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007-2008).[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing#cite_note-2)[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing#cite_note-:1-3) It is intended to stabilize an economic contraction when [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation) is very low or negative and when standard monetary policy instruments have become ineffective. **[Quantitative tightening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_tightening)** (**QT**) does the opposite, where for monetary policy reasons, a central bank sells off some portion of its own held or previously purchased government bonds or other financial assets, to a mix of commercial [banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank) and other financial institutions, usually after periods of their own, earlier, quantitative easing purchases.
