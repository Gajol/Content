+Stefan Sigfinnsson Hi Stefan, Rocket has done a wonderful job of branding their machines. They have a certain sexiness/cool factor - especially machines like the R58 and R60. Detachable PID controller is replaced by in your face branding. Beauty is more than skin deep however. The Profitec Pro 300 is an affordable PID DB machine and does not have some of the finish quality of the flagship Pro 700. Comparing apples to apples like the R58 to the Pro 700 some things to consider: The Pro 700 has some of the finest case craftsmanship we've seen. Clearly evident when looking close at things like the polished welds on internal folds of the drip tray. A little thing, but it suggests a high level of detail. Rocket machines tend to make more use of solenoid valves. On the Pro 700 it's a highly reliable mechanical valve for changing from reservoir to plumbed operation. The R58 uses a solenoid. Another difference is the chassis. On the Pro 700 it's one continuous frame rail front to back. On the R58 the drip tray support is welded onto the frame. Not a big deal for most but requires extra care when packaging for shipment to prevent damage. And the PID... Rocket has chosen to display the actual brew boiler temperature and provide a temp at the group by a chart in the manual. Most machines display the brew temperature based on an offset of temp/pressure measured in the brew boiler. We have from time to time come across some significant discrepancies compared to Scace measurements when converting Rocket brew boiler temps to group temps using their chart. Overall, we find the internal hydraulics and component layout more simple, direct, elegant and potentially more reliable in Profitec machines. That said, Rocket machines must have a quality water supply to avoid issues with their generally more complex internal components.
