|technique - Canada|technique - USA|Description|Use|
|--|--|--|--|
|Offset|V1|Low, squatty body position. Feet in wider stance.  Skis in stronger V-angle (changes with steepness).  Arms and polling is assymmetrical (although Europe is teach symmetry). 3:1 timing - [2-skis/1-pole] at same time, then 1-ski.   |Most Powerful, Least efficient.   For when going slow (slow snow, uphill)|
|One Skate|V2|Pole each leg push.  Ski Down -> Torso-up/poles-up -> pole|Most advanced.  Requires the best balance|
|Two Skate|V2 Alternate|Box-drill.  Similar poling action as One Skate, but only polling on one kick.   AKA ["Russian Dance"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2vfnmRfYCk) with "swing and pole".  "Swing" is arm recovery during off-leg kick, "Pole" is on the pole-kick leg. [Stomp foot down then bring hands forward](https://youtu.be/i2vfnmRfYCk?t=73).  Down-push with both legs equally.|Open field skating.  Most efficient, use to maintain high speed, relaxed, sustainable for long time, least power.  High speed, easy to confuse with V1|

[Nordic Ski Lab - 5 Techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEJnPtrtri4).  In order of power to speed (more glide is you move down list)
1. Diagonal Skate
1. Offset (V1)
1. One Skate (V2)
1. Two Skate (V2 Alternate)
1. Free Skate

Offset and One Skate used the most often.

Diagonal Skate and Offset (V1)
- for uphills
- Diagonal Skate : arms and legs swing in opposition (right leg down, left pole down, ...).  Timing simple to learn as it is like walking.

Offset (V1) Drills
- [V-Hop](https://youtu.be/bnFM5x6jYxo?t=38): athletic stance, forward body lean and hop forward
- no poles V1



[One-Skate](https://youtu.be/QEJnPtrtri4?t=248)
- good to generate power to climb uphills
- good for high-speeds where balance is limiting factor
- used to cross widest range of terrain
- __symmetrical technique__ : double pole on every leg push
- most versatile technique for good skiing (cross widest range of terrain)
- for flat and rolling terrain for beginner / less-skiled skiers  

Drills:
- [V4](https://youtu.be/bnFM5x6jYxo?t=86) - pole twice on each-side.  Land on flat ski, good ankle flexiion, foward hip drive



[two-skate](https://youtu.be/QEJnPtrtri4?t=290)
- assymetrical, pole on every other leg push (because you are travelling faster)
- coordinate pole-push with leg push
- unlike offset, the poles do __not__ set down at the same time
  1. ski lands while hands are swinging back to the start position,
  2. the skiers body extends to a taller position as the ski glides, then
  3. the poling starts as the [pole transition from the glide to the leg push](https://youtu.be/QEJnPtrtri4?t=328)
- mistake: beginners commonly overuse two-skate or homemade-offset on terrain where they could be using one-skate (but they feel like they are skiing to fast to pole with every leg push)
  - problem has to do with their balnace and how their balance.   Beginners [sway-body](https://youtu.be/QEJnPtrtri4?t=362).  They are falling off the supporting ski before they have a chance to get the poles back to the front-position (feel rushed).  

  Concentrate on the [symmetrical technique when learning](https://youtu.be/QEJnPtrtri4?t=390).  Start with diagonal before offset.  Start with:
  - Diagonal
  - One Skate
  - Free Skate
  - do the above before trying the non-symmetrical/asymmetrical one-skate and offset.

  [Free Skate](https://youtu.be/QEJnPtrtri4?t=417)
  - for fastest speeds (just before tuck)
  - beginner friendly (no need to push with poles, can stay low to help with balance), can use arms to simulate jogging, etc.

Skate Skiing Basics
- [Skating Skiing Getting Started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WVLk5suruI).  Upright body, bend your knees, knee over a __flat__ ski, project body foward.  Good description of [kick and how it is different from ice-skating](https://youtu.be/5WVLk5suruI?t=163)
