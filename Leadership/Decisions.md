# Bezos : Type 1 and Typpe 2 Decisions

[Jeff Bezos: There are 2 types of decisions to make, and don't confuse them](https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-on-type-1-and-type-2-decisions-2016-4)
- Type 1 decisions are __not__ reversible, and you have to be very careful making them.
- Type 2 decisions are like walking through a door — if you don't like the decision, you can always go back.

Amazon is the best place in the world to fail because the company is willing to take big risks with the knowledge that 90% of them will fail.

There seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight Type 1 decision-making process on most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions.

The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention. We'll have to figure out how to fight that tendency.

And one-size-fits-all thinking will turn out to be only one of the pitfalls. We'll work hard to avoid it… and any other large organization maladies we can identify.

The opposite situation is less interesting and there is undoubtedly some survivorship bias. Any companies that habitually use the light-weight Type 2 decision-making process to make Type 1 decisions go extinct before they get large.

Take your time. There will be a lot of decisions and opportunities in your life. When the decision is irreversible, give yourself time and space to think it through. When the decision is easily reversible, don't overthink it.[Dries - Drupal - Decisions](https://dri.es/principles-for-life)
