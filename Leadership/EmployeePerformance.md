## OKR - Objectives and Key Results
- OKR's are an alternative to KPIs
- [OKR's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) are from the 1970's at Intel.   Shared with world in 1980 in the book "High Output Management" by Andrew Grove.
- OKR's were adopted by Google.  LinkedIn, Twitter, Uber and Microsoft adopted them.

- KPIs have performance reviews, promotions, salaries and bonuses hinging on meeting at least 100% of the goal
- OKRs have two parts:

- OKRs should be about outcomes, not activities

- only small percentage of what Agile builds gets delivered (8%).  OKRs measure outcomes and not activities.
- OKRs help tie into company objectives.
- OKRS, but tieing into company objectives, help avoid "The JIRA Problem" where developers do not understand the value (value stream) of what they are working on. The Jira Problem:
  - What are you working on? User story 748.
  - What’s that about? To make feature X.
