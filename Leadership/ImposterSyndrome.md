## [Your insecurities aren't what you think they are - Adam Grant](https://www.ted.com/talks/worklife_with_adam_grant_your_insecurities_aren_t_what_you_think_they_are/up-next)

(From Keith Nielsen - Director Cloud Architecture - Discover Financial Services):
This talk by Adam Grant is a great talk on the topic of insecurity, imposter syndrome and I took away a few key thoughts:

* Don't only take on tasks where you know you can succeed
* Understand failing does not translate to being a failure
* Focus on intrinsic motivation vs extrinsic, don't always go looking for external validation, there will always be someone that takes issue with what you have done
* Focus on getting better not looking good
