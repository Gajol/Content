# Psychological Safety
- [TED Talk - Psychological Safety](https://youtu.be/LhoLuui9gX8)

> Itâ€™s about establishing a climate in which people feel comfortable admitting to well-intentioned mistakes without being harangued or punished.

| No One Wants to Look | Impression Management           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Ignorant             | Don't Ask Questions             |
| Incompetent          | Don't Admit Weakness or Mistake |
| Intrusive            | Don't Offer Ideas               |
| Negative             | Don't Critique the Status Quo   |



## Creating a Workplace Culture of Psychological Safety


1. Frame Work as a Learning Problem not an Execution Problem
   - There is enormous uncertainty and interdependence.  We have never been here before. We can't now what will happen.  We have to have everyone's brain and voices in the game.


1. Acknowledge your own Fallibility: 
   - Say simple things, like "I may have missed something, I need to hear from you.".  Creates more safety for speaking up.


1. Model Curiosity
   - Ask a lot of questions.  Creates a necessity for "voice" and people's opinions.

## Accountability

How does psychological safety compete with accountability?   It is a matter of finding the right balance.  They are two different dimensions (car analogy breaks and gas pedal.  Psychologic safety eases up on the brakes)

- hold people accountable for great results
- psychological safety is needed when there is uncertainty and interdependence

|                               | Accountability Low | Accountability High                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **High Psychological Safety** | Comfort Zone       | Learning Zone \|\| Performance Zone |
| **Low Psychological Safety**  | Apathy Zone        | Anxiety Zone                        |
