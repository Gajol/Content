## Why Positivity Matters

Dr Barbara Fredickson : Positve Pychologist

- Barbara Fredrickson - [Pursuit of Happiness](https://www.pursuit-of-happiness.org/history-of-happiness/barb-fredrickson)
- [Broaden and Build Theory - Review of General Psychology in 1998](https://positivepsychology.com/broaden-build-theory/) :
  1. Positive Emotions
  1. Broaden
  1. Build
  1. Transform


- [Broad and Build Theory - LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/broaden-build-theory-corey-s-major)


## Positive Emotions
Broaden your presepctives 16' : More enthusiatic of interacting with the world.  Emotions research : fearful, anxious, concerned and afraid - we avoid, pull back and more risk adverse and unwilling to engage.  Miss opportunities in environment.  Positive frame of mind and emotions results in more innovation, engagement.
- threats, vs opportunities : what can I capatilize on.
- building capabilities, building knowledge, : leads to gains.  
- when you succeed, you get recognition and give recognition and repeat.  Postive re-affirment cycle.

Emotions are contagious : Tiger and Eore.  Focus on the Positive.   
- this is absolutely impossible, what a mess.  Emotions are contagious.
- to influence others around us - check you mood - will this have a positive impact or raise concerns.

Strengths : Represent our inner talents which have invested in development.  
Talent * Investment = Strength

People who use their strengths are more often:
- demonstrate more resilience
- perform better at work
- are more likely to achieve their goals
- are more engaged to work
- are more effective at developing themselves
- exhibit more confidence
- experience less stress
- happier

Strengths in Action - Resilience
- How can I apply my strengths in this situation.

Self-Leadership is *massive*.
- How well do I apply my strenghts in this role/problem?
- How can I apply my strengths in this situation. Operationalize your strenghts  
- Who Can support me in doing this?  Strengths based conversation.  Gallop reasearch (people who use strenghts perform better and are more resilient.  Get feedback, truly understand. Empathy and understand.

Reslience Building - Synthesize
- Think of a situation that you thought was impossible in the past.
  - What strenghts did I leverage to get through that?
  - What resources did I draw from?
  - What did I learn in this process?

- Powerful : Through this excercise, I had constraints, talents and unique gifts.   Remind yourself of what you bring to table.
- Updating your resume helps you realize the amazing things you have accomplished.  Emotions - fearful -> looking inward.

# Questions

## Can you learn to be more empathetic?
- Yes, empathy can be learned, just like resilience.   Awareness and application.  

Why focus on my strengths?  Won't my weaknesses give me a greater return on investment?

- Focusing on strengths is 3X more improvement.  
- You are more mobilized and engaged on working on your strengths. 
- Working on weaknesses is not part of human motivation.  
- The things you least like to do are not part of the human motivational system.  
- One caveat, exception, is if it is a fatal flaw - prevents you from moving forward.  Story, a man named Zenger-Bolton (??), sails to island.  Leak, a bit of water.   Timeline.  Is it worth it?   Get the wind in our sails we will get their faster.  If there is a massive hole in the hull - then you must fix it first.

## Negative, Positive : Can you perceive this as disconnected.
Focus on the positive, not exclusive of the negative. Does the emotional expression match the current situation we are in.  Put on curiousity hat, be empatheitc and ask questions, Probe a little, gather information, coeaching & development moment.

See situation as an opportunity or an impossible problem?  What is it in this situation that someone is seeing or not?
- We have to acknowledge reality.   We are under really challenging timelines, we are underrsources, and despite these barriers we must figure out how to move together.  It is essential to be connected to what is going on and clearly articulating your perspective.


# What is Empathy
Empathy Video 2012 VW Passat $20,000 : Reaction : Reckonizing & understanding someone else's perspective.  Possitive Leadership .

4 Components
46' [Brené Brown - TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_the_power_of_vulnerability?language=en) / RSA

1. Perspective: Ability to take perspective of someone else.  Walk a mile in someone else's shows. Examine different points of vue.  Think of what their situation must be like.  
  - Common mistep : Think about what their situation is like & project what they must be going through base on our own values, beliefs and expectations.  That drives disconnection. They are different than us.
  - Perspective getting: ask questions. Don't make assumptions about where people are.
1.  Appreciate others as human beings without passing judgement.  Try to figure it out, ask lots of questions without judgement.
1.  Understand Feelings : Tenir Compte des sentiments.
1.  Communicate our Understanding : Communique son interpretation des choses.

Perspective Getting:  Don't make assumptions on where people are.  Mindful of: Are we truly taking their perspective?  Or are we just projection their situation on our own and thinking about how we would feel in their situation (bad). (this drives disconnection, because they are fine with what is going on, because they are different than us).

- Be curious:  Look at yourself like sherlock holmes.  Ask lots of questions.  Listen without judgement.
- Seek first to understand than to be understood.   A

Anxierty dampens empathy.  When we are stressed it impacts our empathy.
- You won't always exhibit the same levels of empathy.  Use your self-awareness to moderate your behviours.

Why care about empathy?
- medical science:  patients more inclined to report more about their symptoms and concerns.  Apply to any domain leadership, romantic partner, friend, ...
- increased compliance and satisfaction rates : co-creating a future path
- fewer malpractice claims
- apologized : i really made a mistake here, and I own up to what i did, it was wrong, and this led to a complication.  Less likely to be sued.   People recognize we are going to make misteps.
- how we deal with mistakes is most critical.

- management research group / 360 : assessed by direct reports, peers
  - of 22 competencies, empathy was 3rd strongest predictor of executive excellence.  #1 - strategic thinking, #2 - communication :  trinity of executive excellence.
  - empathy informs our ability to be strategic.  You need a connection with stakeholder community if you have no idea about the needs.
  - ethical leadership can be predicted by empathy (strongest indicator)
  - allows humanistic judgement on path forward

- trust : good listenting
  - empathy is intertriwed with trust.  You must care about someone's situation to establish trust.  Understanding does not equal agreeement.  Who you are, what you believe, what your experiences are.
  - conflict research : people go along with decisions, what prolong's conflict is if people do not feel heard.  If I feel you genuinely have taken time and exhibited an interest in what I had to say.  And then you choose otherwise, I appreciate the opportunity to share my opinion.

How to Exhibit Empathy

- Invalidating: Stop saying "At least...you have children, you tried, ...":   Why?  It is dismissive.  They came to us with a challenge, expressing vulnerability.   In return, you are saying hey look at this bright shiny stuff.  Which means "you have no right to have those feelings".  That is not the intention, but that is how it lands / is perceived.  You are invalidating their emotional response.
  - They feel more bad for sharing, and they will unlikely share in the future.

Effective Listening

- Eye Contact
- Distraction Free
- Clarifying Questions
- Summarizing
- Not reacting, but understanding

Listening is an empathy super-power.   

Bad
- Listener abstains from speaking
- Facial expression is not a great.
- Parroting back (bad), paraphrasing is good.

Good
- ask questions.  The more you ask questions the higher the rated skill you are as a conversationalist.  
- build up the other person.  When they leave the conversation, they feel as good as when they came in.  
- cooperative and not competitive.  Well you thought you had a bad day...
- make suggestions.  This inserts yourself into the conversation.  The problem is to make it relevant and meaningful.  Listen first, ask questions, build-up the other person - then - make suggestions.  Take the time and earn the right to share your perspective.

Listening Strategies. 1h05
- Ask Questions.  High-performing teams ask questions (1 : 1 to statement/question)
- Type of Questions. : [Change Your Questions Change Your Life - Dr Marilee Adams](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1105799238)
Judger Questions   What's wrong, Whose fault is it, What's Wrong With Me?, ...
Learning Mindset Queations:   What works? What do I want?   What can I learn?  What am I responsible for?   (Energizing conversation..., unlocks perspective of other person)

- Ask more "What" questions and not "Why?"
  - Why did you do this?   It leads to defensiveness.   We have self-talk narrative to ourselves (why did you do this, what prompted you to say this?) - Same end go very different between What & Why.
  - Humans often don't know why we do stuff.  It is outside of our awareness it is subconcious.  "What" helps you operationalize and identify the triggers.  Powerful for learing and reflections.

Book Crucial Conversations - Amplication Model -

How to Amplify our LIstenting - 4 step process

- Ask
- Mirror : mirror emotional intensity of the situation. Build relationship with new born (mirror their mannerisms).  Mody language, tone of voice.
- Paraphrase : Report it back based on how you heard it.
- Prime : Prime the conversation.  "What I most is that we can have as constructive a conversation as possible...".  Acknowledge the situation we are in.

Virtual World Strategies
- Phone
- Email : no body language, tone of voice.  What is the purpose, conveying information (meeting minutes - one way push) - awesome.    Email sucks at:

                - problem solving
                - negotiation
                - delivering feedback
                - managing conflict

The complexity of the communication medium must match the complexity mediume (text / email is low complexity).

Break Golden Rule : Treat others the way you want to be treated.  
- problem with that is "they are not us" - perspectiving taking vs perspective getting
- at the heart of so much conflict
- Platinum Rule: treat others the way they wish to be treated


Focus on the Positive
- Why Positivity Matters
- The Power of Strengths
- Leverage our Strengths

Empathy : we need each other, understand other perspectives.  

How to re-establish trust, when leaders have lost trust/confidence and employees are disengaged.

- identify and acknowledge situation openly.   
- apologize, own it, I'm sorry.  
- you don't feel safe to share your ideas with me.
- from this point forward, I'm committing to this a, b, c, ...
- here's where I am going and I need you to get me there.
- acknowledge it will take time to rebuild the trust with you.  I will do everything I can to regain it.  Whenever I am doing something that is losing trust, I need you to raise your hand.  I cannot do this on my own.  I need your help.
- I'm going to make mistakes and I need you to get me there.
- Do not make *any* excuses for it.  Demonstrate ownerhsip and own the behaviour fully and completely.  Do not provide context.  It is not genuine.
- Postive change is about awareness.  Acceptance of who and where we are.
- I'm sorry that you feel that way.  BAD!  Implies you are incompetent.   Better to not say anything.
- Take accountability.  This is where I am going.  Build a support network to get there.

Empathetic Leaders Perceived to Deliver on All Expections - How to say you have heard them, but I may not be able to deliver.
- I heard you
- Thank you
- I will take it into consideration
- Priming : Answer is within yourself.
- If there is something that bothers you my decisions, please follow-up with me, I want to understand and continue to have the dialogue.
- Do not resist feedback.  You always have choice to hear feedback and disagree.  People are more concerned with being heard, not about following what they are looking for.    

Humility : Irony
- What people want to see in leaders = Humility.
- Leaders say humility is at the bottom for being successful.  







We tend to lead with judge mindset.

- [Admiral McRaven ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBuIGBCF9jc)  : 10 Lessons - Basic Seal Training [Speech](https://jamesclear.com/great-speeches/make-your-bed-by-admiral-william-h-mcraven)
  1. Start the Day with a Task Completed: Make your bed to perfection.
  2. Success in Life Requires Teamwork: Find Someone to Help you Through Life: Everyone must paddle.  You can't change the world on your own.  You will need help.  Coxon - find someone to help you.
  3. Respect Everyone: It’s What’s Inside that Counts : Measure a person by the size of the heart, not the size of their flippers.
  4. Life is not always fair, move foward: Know that Life is not Fair, and, that you will fail often:  Setback Is Only Permanent if You Let It Be :  If you want to change the world, get over being a sugar cookie and keep moving forward.
  5. Don't be afraid to fail often:  Setback Is Only Permanent if You Let It Be
  : Life is filled with circuses. You will fail. You will likely fail often.
  6. Take some Risks: Be Daring in Life :  If you want to change the world, sometimes you have to slide down the obstacles head first[Slope Slide](https://youtu.be/TBuIGBCF9jc?t=522)
  7. Step up when Times are Toughest: Keep Courage Close:  So, if you want to change the world, don't back down from the sharks.  There are a lot of sharks in the world. If you hope to complete the swim you will have to deal with them.
  8. Stand Tall in the Midst of Darkness : If you want to change the world, you must be your very best in the darkest moment.
  9. Inspire Others with Hope : Never Give Up: Lift Up the Downtrodden: if you want to change the world, start singing when you're up to your neck in mud..  If I have learned anything in my time traveling the world, it is the power of hope.  The power of one person — Washington, Lincoln, King, Mandela and even a young girl from Pakistan, [Malala](https://malala.org/malalas-story/) — one person can change the world by giving people hope.  Be the one who makes a difference in someone else’s life by giving them hope for the future
  10.  No Matter What, Never Give Up If you want to change the world don't ever, ever ring the bell.

“Life is a struggle and the potential for failure is ever present, but those who live in fear of failure, or hardship, or embarrassment will never achieve their potential. Without pushing your limits, without occasionally sliding down the rope headfirst, without daring greatly, you will never know what is truly possible in your life.”
― William H. McRaven : McRaven oversaw Operation Neptune Spear, the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May 2011. He is currently a professor of National Security, LBJ School of Public Affairs, the University of Texas.May 21, 2021
