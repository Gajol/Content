The Westrum

Ron Westrum researched human factors in system safety relating to hilghly complex systems in aviation and healthcare.  In 1988, Westrum developed a topology of organizatoins:

- Pathological: Power-oriented organizations are characterized by large amounts of fear and threat. People often hoard information or withhold it for political reasons or distort it to make themselves look better.
- Bureaucratic:  rule-oriented organizations protect departments. Those in the department want to maintain their turf, insist on their own rules, and generally do things by the book, their book.
- Generative: Generative or performance-oriented organizations focus on the mission.
.


## Culture
Westrum organizational culture is one of a set of capabilities that drive higher software delivery and organizational performance.

A typology of organizational cultures:
- suppression: Harming or stopping the person bringing the anomaly to light; "shooting the messenger"
- encapsulation: Isolating the messenger, so that the message is not heard
- public relations: Putting the message "in context" to minimise its impact
- local fix: An attempt to respond to the problem wherever it exists.  Common in aviation when a single problem will direct attention to similar ones elsewhere
- inquiry: Attempting to get at the "root causes" of the problem.

## How Businesses Process Information
Westrum identifies six(6) aspects to how organizations process information.   These are known as the Westrum model of organization culture:

|Pathological|Bureaucratic|Generative|
|--|--|--|
|__Power Oriented__|__Rule Oriented__|__Performance Oriented__|
|1. Low cooperation.|Modest cooperation.|High cooperation|
|2. Messengers shot.|Messenger's neglected.|Messenger's trained|
|3. Responsibilities shirked.|Narrow responsibilities.|Risks are shared.|
|4. Bridging discouraged.|Bridging tolerated.|Bridging encouraged|
|5. Failure leads to Scapegoating.|Failure leads to justice|Failure leads to Inquiry|
|6. Novelty crushed|Novelty leads to Problems|Novelty implemented|

Copied from [Google Westrum Article](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/ /devops-culture-westrum-organizational-culture):

__High cooperation__. Create cross-functional teams that include representatives from each functional area of the software delivery process (business analysts, developers, quality engineers, ops, security, and so on). This practice lets everyone share the responsibility for building, deploying, and maintaining a product. It's also important that there is good cooperation within the team.

__Train the messengers__. This means we want people to bring us bad news so we can make things better. Hold blameless postmortems. By removing blame, you remove fear; and by removing fear, you enable teams to surface problems and solve them more effectively. Also create and foster an environment where it is safe to take smart risks and fail, so that anyone can surface problems at any time—even without the ceremony of a postmortem.

__Share risks__. Along with this, encourage shared responsibilities. Quality, availability, reliability and security are everyone's job. One way to improve the quality of your services is to ensure that developers share responsibility for maintaining their code in production. The improvement in collaboration that comes from sharing responsibility inherently reduces risk: The more eyes on the software delivery process, the more you'll avoid errors in process or planning. Automation also reduces risk, and with the right tool choice, can enable collaboration.

__Encourage bridging__. Break down silos. In addition to creating cross-functional teams, techniques for breaking down silos include co-locating ops with the dev team; including ops in planning throughout the software delivery lifecycle; and implementing ChatOps. Another tip is to identify someone in the organization whose work you don't understand (or whose work frustrates you, like procurement) and invite them to coffee or lunch. Informal discussions help foster better communication, and you may understand why they do what they do—and you can come up with creative solutions together.

__Let failure lead to inquiry__. Again, hold blameless postmortems. The response to failure shapes the culture of an organization. Blaming individuals for failures creates a negative culture. If instead, failures lead you to ask questions about what caused the failures and how you can keep them from happening again in the future, you've improved your technical system, your processes, and your culture.

__Implement novelty__. Encourage experimentation. Giving employees freedom to explore new ideas can lead to great outcomes. Some companies give engineers time each week for experimentation. Others host internal hack days or mini-conferences to share ideas and collaborate. Many new features and products began this way. When you release your employees from habitual pathways and repetitive tasks, they can generate enormous value for your organization. And remember that novelty isn't limited to new products and features. Also encourage and reward improvements in process and ideas that help foster collaboration.

## Characteristics of Information
Westrum provides three characteristics of good information:
1. __Answers Question__: It provides answers to the questions that the receiver needs answered.
1. __Timely__: It is timely.
1. __Audience Aware__: It is presented in such a way that the receiver can use it effectively.
