Portfolio management is about managing multiple stocks, which have different characteristics such as return and risk. The ultimate aim in forming a portfolio is to get the highest return with the lowest risk assumed. Markowitz Portfolio Theory tackles this issue in a nice and clean way.

In this lab, I introduce:

# Prospect Theory - Kahneman 1979

Prospect Theory identified the loss aversion factor within human decision making (behavioural economics).  Prospect theory is a psychology theory that describes how people make decisions when presented with alternatives that involve risk, probability, and [uncertainty](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/uncertainty/). It holds that people make decisions based on perceived losses or gains.

> This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of  decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. 

> Many economic decisions involve transactions in which one pays money in  exchange for a desirable prospect. Current decision theories analyze such problems as comparisons between the status quo and an alternative state which  includes the acquired prospect minus its cost.

Criticisms:  One of the criticisms of the prospects theory is that it lacks psychological explanations for the process it talks about. The criticism comes from other psychologists who notes that factors such as human emotional and affective responses that are important in the decision-making process are absent in the model.
