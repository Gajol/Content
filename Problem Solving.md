Problem Solving: Problem solving is the answer to the question “What should I do?” It’s interesting when there’s uncertainty and complexity, and when it’s meaningful because there are consequences.

## Structured Problem Solving

A structured problem solving helps to :

- more clearly understand what problem we are solving, 
- what are the components of the problem we are solving, 
- which components of the problem we are solving, 
- which components are the most important ones for us to pay attention to, 
- which analytic techniques we should apply to those components
- how we can synthesize what we have learned into a compelling story

There is a scope for creativity

## Problem Statement: 

You need a concise problem statement.

Bad: "Can we grow in Japan"

The most powerful thing is to step back and ask the basic questions—

- What are we trying to solve? 
- What are the constraints that exist? 
- What are the dependencies?” 

Make these explicit, and help define the definition and thinking.   Words are debated - if you’re a logic purist, is great. You debate. “Is it an ‘or’? Is it an ‘and’? What’s the action verb?”

The first meeting, with stakeholders, you will spend significant time and effort on defining the problem statement.  Let’s make those explicit and really push the thinking and defining. At McKinsey, we spend an enormous amount of time in writing that little statement, and the statement, if you’re a logic purist, is great. You debate. “Is it an ‘or’? Is it an ‘and’? What’s the action verb?” Because all these specific words help you get to the heart of what matters.

Steps:

1. Define the Problem Context
2. Break Down the Problem
3. Prioriization
4. Work Plan
5. Analysis
6. Synthesize 
7. Storytell

## Define the problem context:

- What are the forces acting upon the decision maker?
- How quickly is an answer required?
- What precision is required with the result?
- Are there areas that are off-limits, or, desirable?
- Is the decision maker open to exploring other areas?

> How often do especially bright young people run off with half of the idea about what the problem is and start collecting data and start building models—only to discover that they’ve really gone off half-cocked.

## Break Down the Problem - Disaggregation

Use logic trees to disaggregate the problem. Every problem we’re solving has some complexity and some uncertainty.  The only way that we can really get our team working on the problem is to take the problem apart into logical pieces.

Disaggregate the problem from two to three different perspectives, using logic trees.   This will help inform on what aspects of the problem we should be looking at and assign those to team members.

## Rigorous Prioritization

- How important is this branch of the tree?
- How much can I move?  Focus attention on those with big impact and movable (i.e., levels we can affect)

People spend a lot of time arguing about branches that are either not important or that none of us can change. We see it in the public square. When we deal with questions at the policy level—“Should you support the death penalty?” “How do we affect climate change?” “How can we uncover the causes and address homelessness?”—it’s even more important that we’re focusing on levers that are big and movable.

## Work Plan

Break the work among team members so that people have a clear piece of work to do; with clear time lines. Define specific analyses that is required.  Understand depth-levels required and ensure the work plan supports this depth.  Allow for iterations (Level 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3) to achieve the precision and stakeholder engagement and endorsement required.    Allow for one-hour, one-days analysis.

- low-depth (Level 0):  Not a lot of depth, and will not have broad stakeholder backing.   Can be useful as starting points.
- deep (Level 3).  Whole model validated in three different ways.  

>  Every time you see a 50-page work plan that stretches out to three months, you know it’s wrong. — Problem Solving is an iterative learning process.

Lengthy work-plans (50-pages, 3-month duration) is wrong.  Problem solving is an iterative learning process.

- define what is expected of use
- when we need to deliver
- how we are progressing toward the answer
- helps deal with biases

## Analysis

There is a wide range of tools to do the analysis.   Start with simple heuristics and explanatory statistics before using complex "big-gun" tools.  The analysis should first help understand the shape and scope of the problem before applying the massive complex analytical approaches.

Heuristics

- heuristics before deep modeling exercise
- maximize learning: test & learn; iterate
- A/B testing is a problem solving methodology.  A/B testing uses feedback loops (and is iterative)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- test with your data.   Setup an environment to test.
- don’t get caught up in neural-network modeling immediately
  - first setup simpler models
  - is the data right?  is it integral and sound?  does it make sense?

### Machine Learning

Modern concept that if you have enough data and enough algorithms you will find things that you would not have otherwise noticed.  Does machine learning revolutionize the problem-solving process?

- ML can be revolutionary.  Pattern recognition is one.  ML is not a replacement for solid problem solving.  Problem definition is paramount.  
- ML without understanding algorithms will likely lead to biases.

## Bias

Bias:  Bias is a feature of every human decision-making process. If we design our team interactions intelligently, we can avoid the worst sort of biases.  These are the cognitive biases that behavioral sciences have shown we all carry around, things like anchoring, over optimism—these kinds of things.

**Availability bias**: Availability bias is the one that I’m always alert to. You think you’ve seen the problem before, and therefore what’s available is your previous conception of it—and we have to be most careful about that. 

**Sunflower bias**: biases that are based on hierarchies.  Address this by making sure that the youngest team members speak first.  The oldest team members should not speak first because it’s easy for people to look at who’s senior and alter their own creative approaches.

### Techniques to Help Remove Bias

Ask Questions: “This was true in what context?” You’re trying to apply something that worked in one context to a different one. That can be deadly if the context has changed, and that’s why organizations struggle to change.  You promote all these people because they did something that worked well in the past, and then there’s a disruption in the industry, and they keep doing what got them promoted even though the context has changed.

- **What was this bias call - the caveman bias**

Diversity: why diversity in our teams is so important. It’s one of the best things about the world that we’re in now. We’re likely to have people from different socioeconomic, ethnic, and national backgrounds, each of whom sees problems from a slightly different perspective. It is therefore much more likely that the team will uncover a truly creative and clever approach to problem solving.

Junior Speak First: Allow their opinion to be heard, and for their opinion to not be biased by senior members.

## Synthesise & Story Tell

Synthesize the pieces that came out of the analysis and weave those into a story that helps people answer the question “What should I do?”.

> Until you motivate people to action, you actually haven’t solved anything.

If you do not synthesis and story tell well, you have wasted your time.  You will only have a bunch of analysis.

## Other Guidance

Uncertainty:  Uncertainty is dealt with at every step of the process.   You need to understand the sources of uncertainty, and whether they are important.

- which branches of the logic tree are more certain or less certain
- prioritization may put more emphasis on the low probability and huge impact; or very likely and reasonable impact.
- synthesis: you need to be nuanced about what you’re understanding, the likelihood.  Oftentimes people lack humility in the way they make their recommendations.  "This is the answer!".    They’re very precise, and I think we would all be well-served to say, “This is a likely answer under the following sets of conditions” and then make the level of uncertainty clearer, if that is appropriate.
  - t doesn’t mean you’re always in the gray zone; it doesn’t mean you don’t have a point of view. It just means that you can be explicit about the certainty of your answer when you make that recommendation.
- “Acknowledge and embrace the uncertainty. Don’t pretend that it isn’t there. Be very clear about what the uncertainties are up front, and then build that into every step of the process.”

## Design Thinking

Design Thinking is another structured problem solving methodology.

- **User Empathy**: It starts with an incredible amount of empathy for the user and uses that to define the problem. It does pause and go out in the wild and spend an enormous amount of time seeing how people interact with objects, seeing the experience they’re getting, seeing the pain points or joy—and *<u>uses that to infer and define the problem</u>*.

  - With an enormous amount of empathy. There’s a huge emphasis on empathy. Traditional, more classic problem solving is you define the problem based on an understanding of the situation.  This one almost presupposes that we don’t know the problem until we go see it. 

- **Multiple Scenarios**: Design Thinking comes up with multiple scenarios or answers or ideas or concepts, and there’s a lot of divergent thinking initially.  This diverges from problem solving where in the prioritization steps, the logic trees branches are prioritized. Eventually, Design Thinking leads to a “OK, I’m going to converge again.” decision.

  - **User Iterations**: Then you go and you bring things back to the customer and get feedback and iterate. Then you rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. There’s a lot of tactile building, along the way, of prototypes and things like that. It’s very iterative.

  Design Thinking and Problem Solving are complementary.

  - **define**: problem definition well in classic problem solving, we are demonstrating the kind of empathy, at the very beginning of our problem, that design thinking asks us to approach
  - **ideate**: very similar to problem solving disaggregation, prioritization, and work-planning steps
    - The best teams allow divergent thinking to bump them off whatever their initial biases in problem solving are. 
  - design thinking gives us a constant reminder of <u>creativity</u>, <u>empathy</u>, and the tactile nature of problem solving, but it’s absolutely complementary, not alternative.

Do people with design-thinking backgrounds really work well together with classical problem solvers?

- not easy when people have spent an enormous amount of time seeped in design thinking or user-centric design
- If the person who’s applying classic problem-solving methodology is very rigid and mechanical in the way they’re doing it, there could be an enormous amount of tension
-  there’s not clarity in the role and not clarity in the process, I think having the two together can be, sometimes, problematic

Artifacts:

- Problem Solving -> Model
- Design Thinking -> Prototype
  - Rather than writing a big deck with all my supporting evidence, they’ll bring an example, a thing, and that feels different. 
  - Then you spend your time differently to achieve those two end products, so that’s another source of friction.

Collaboration:  Problem Solvers & Design Thinkers: Now, I still think it can be an incredibly powerful thing to have the two—if there are the right people with the right mind-set, if there is a team that is explicit about the roles, if we’re clear about the kind of outcomes we are attempting to bring forward. There’s an enormous amount of collaborativeness and respect.

- they have to respect each other’s methodology 
- they have to be prepared to be flexible in how this process is going to work

## Business Process Mapping

[Business Mapping Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_mapping)

The Major Steps of Process Improvement using Process Mapping

1. Process identification - identify objectives, scope, players and work areas.
2. Information gathering - gather process facts (what, who, where, when) from the people who do the work.
3. Process Mapping - convert facts into a process map.
4. Analysis - work through the map, challenging each step (what-why?, who-why?, where-why?, when-why?, how-why?)
5. Develop/Install New Methods - eliminate unnecessary work, combine steps, rearrange steps, add new steps where necessary
6. Manage process - maintain process map in library, review routinely, and monitor process for changes

Process mapping is capable of supporting several important business goals:

- Business process improvement
- Training
- Process / workflow clarification
- Regulatory compliance
- Internal audit
- Role clarity ([RACI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix))

### Six Sigman & Businss Process Mapping

[Six Sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma) practitioners use the term Business Process Architecture to describe the mapping of business processes as series of cross-functional flowcharts. Under this school of thought, each flowchart is of a certain level (between 0 and 4) based on the amount of detail the flowchart contains. A level 0 flowchart represents the least amount of detail, and usually contains one or two steps. A level 4 flowchart represents the most detail, and can include hundreds of steps. At this level every task, however minor, is represented. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_mapping))
