- Book Title: [*Jay, Meg. The Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter and How to Make the Most of Them Now. First revised trade paperback edition. New York: Twelve, 2021*](https://worldcat.org/en/title/1241709696).

# Summary

The book provides insights into the challenges modern young adults in their 20's face.  The epilogue sums it up the best: There is no formula for a good life.  There is no right and wrong.

> __Am I going to make it?__
>
> *I don't know.  You haven't decided yet.*

The author, [Meg Jay](https://megjay.com/about/), wrote this book to help people in their 20's.  The author identifies that changing world, expectations and pressures on people in their 20's and relates their concerns.   There is life guidance in terms being deliberate in your choices.   Meg's Ted Talk, [Why 30 is not the new 20](https://www.ted.com/talks/meg_jay_why_30_is_not_the_new_20), is famous for framing contemporary twentysomethings journey into adulthood.

The twenties are important for many reasons.  In their 20's:

- 80% of person's defining moments occur
- A person's earning power is defined in the first 10 years of work
- Half the people get married
- A person brain changes the most
- A person's personality changes the most
- A person's social network is at its biggest
- A person experiences the most uncertain years

# Introduction

In the 21st century, in just one generation, our culture has changed from immediately leaving home, studying, graduating, marrying and raising a family.  There is now a gap between the time when one lives in their childhood home and when they have their own home.

| Childhood Home | *What to do with this time* | Own Home |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | -------- |

Essential questions are being asked during this time:

- Will I be successful?
- Will I be alone?
- Will I be loved?
- Will I be happy?
- Will my life have meaning?

The book discusses three main areas, Work, Life and Mind & Body.   Several tools (12 tools) are provided, as well as 12 useful "learning questions".   Homework [^Homework] is assigned on topics relating to the major areas.

The book ends with the author providing a story relating to anxiety about "Will Things Work out For Me".  She describes her starting on a hike in a national park and being worried about whether she would make it or not; and wondering if she should embark on the journey.  She asks the park ranger, "Am I going to make it?".  "I don't know, you have haven't decided yet" is the response.

## Identity Capital

> You can't think your way through life...the only way to figure out what to do is to do something.

- [Eric Erikson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Erikson), a psychologist in the 1950's coined the phrase [identity crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_crisis).   He was half-Jewish and half-German.   Uncertain about his vocation and his fit in society, Erik dropped out of school and began a lengthy period of roaming about Germany and Italy as a wandering artist with his childhood friend Peter Blos and others. For children from prominent German families, taking a "wandering year" was not uncommon.  
  - Erik Erikson is best known for his famous theory of psychosocial development and the concept of the [identity crisis](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-an-identity-crisis-2795948). His theories marked an important shift in thinking [on personality](https://www.verywellmind.com/facts-about-personality-2795436); instead of focusing simply on early childhood events, his psychosocial theory looks at how social influences contribute to our personalities throughout our entire lifespans.

Identity capital is defined as:

- Our stock of personal assets.
- How we add value to who we are.
- What we have to show for how we spent our time.
- The investments we made in ourselves.

Identity capital is built by:

- explore and commit: Exploring and committing leads to higher self-esteem, more persevering and more realistic.  Crisis & captial go together.
  - greater sense of self
  - greater life satisfaction
  - better stress management
  - stronger reasoning and resistance to conformity

Crisis and capital go together.  Capital is accumulated bit-by-bit over time.   Explore & commit results in:

- higher self-esteem
- more perservering
- more realistic
- greater sense of self
- greater life satisfaction
- better stress management
- stronger reasoning & resistance to conformity

## Strength of  Weak Ties

*The Strength of Weak Ties*[^WeakTies] thesis is that weak ties—acquaintanceships that are not reinforced by many mutual friendships—are especially pivotal in the flow of information. It has become a core idea in the field of social networks. In marketing, information science, or politics, weak ties enable reaching populations and audiences that are not accessible via strong ties

The strength of weak ties[^WeakTies].  Weak ties have more impact on ones life than the close connections we have in our urban lives.  The essence is that our habitual ties do not bring new information or opportunities into our lives.   The urban close ties we have are supportive but not transformative.

- 75% of people's new jobs come for assistance with weak ties.

| Relationship Type | Characteristics                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Strong Ties       | Comfortable and familiar<br />*birds of a feather, stick together*<br />love of the same<br />comfortable and familiar<br />offer support and sympathy |
| Weak Ties         | Know things we do not<br />Offer something new<br />Bridges to something new. |

### Ben Franklin Effect

> *He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged.* — The Ben Franklin Effect 1706 - 1790

Homophily: A theory in sociology that people tend to form connections with others who are similar to them in characteristics such as socioeconomic status, values, beliefs, or attitudes.

[Nepotism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nepotism): When someone gets something they don't deserve.  favouritism (as in appointment to a job) based on kinship

Why weak ties are often helpful:

- When you do something nice for someone, you like them even more afterward.  (Social Psychology)

How to approach a weak tie for help:

- Ask for a clearly defined and easily deliverable favour.   Exploit the helper's high and the Ben Franklin effect.
- Make yourself relevant and interesting.
- Do your homework.

## The Unthought Known

Unthought unknowns refer to:

- the things we know about ourselves but forgot
- the dreams we lost sight of
- the truths we sense but don't say out loud

We fear what the unthought unknowns means and what we should do next.   Our fear (and anxiety) is that making a choice will lead to hard work, failure and heart break.

D -->|positively| I[Better Informed, Idenity Capital]

Paradox of Choice[^Choice-Paradox].  The example in the book is a study where two different booths with choices of jam were provided.   One booth had 18 choices and one had 6.

- most people went to the booth with 18 choices, but only 3% bought jam
- fewer people went to the booth with 6 flavours, but 30% bought jam

## My Life Should Look Better on Instagram

> *Don't compare yourself to other people; Compare yourself to who you were yesterday." — Jordan Peterson Psychologist

The more time people spend on social media has been proven to lead people:

- to be more anxious
- to be more depressed
- to have lower self-esteem
- to have higher eating disorders
- to have increased fear of missing out (FOMO)
- to have increased unhappinness

The key driver to these negative effects is *Upwards Social Comparison* — "compare and despair"

## The Search for Glory

> *The best is the enemy of the good*. — Voltaire (Philosopher)
>
> *Happiness is when you think and what you do are in harmony.* — Mahatma Gandhi (Philosopher)

- realize your potential is a function of your gifts and limitations
- scramling for ideals: alienated about ourselves & world
- search for glory: "should do...", "supposed to ...".  "Should" are a <u>false dichotomy</u> between meeting an ideal or being a failure.

Goals: Goals lead us from within.  Goals are like authentic dreams.

Expectations: Judge us from the outside "should do...", "supposed to ...".  Expectations are oppressive standards (not the same as high standards)

Many people, especially those in their 20's, focus on the "expectations" search for glory as opposed to a more positive goal-seeking approach.   Some factors influencing this are:

- school-life is very structured.  You follow directions, complete your assignments and tests and are provided feedback in the form of a grade.
- work life is unstructured and self-directed

## The Customized Life

Distinctiveness is a fundamental part of identity:

- It is sometimes easier to identify what we are not (a negative approach)
- we need to identify what we are (a positive approach)
  - affirmative step and process
  - what are for? (being against something is easy)
  - claim something

The book describes a story about a person who is in search of their next opportunity with their interest in riding a custom bike.  The concept of a bike being a set of standard parts and an iterative process to add customizations is paralleled to the means with which we can customize our life.

- standard parts: education, start career (can iterate through standard parts, too)
- custom parts: jobs, experiences, skills, improvements, choices (iterate!!)

Claim a Story:  Claim a good story.  Who you are.  What you want.

## Good Story

Claim a story:

- that is about your interests and talents.   
- that is a narrative you can bring to interviews and dates
- that balances complexity and cohesion
  - balances: communication and reasoning is bettern than originality and creativity in the story
  - complexity: if the story is too simple, the story will seem inexperienced and lacking
  - cohesion: diagnostic, provide the past, present  and future.

You have to take action, make choices.  Debating isn't going to get you anywhere.  This aligns with the book *Think Fast, Think Slow* which advises one to take calculated risks more often.  When choices have a probability of having a positive contribution, then the more often we make these choices, the better we will be.

# Love

In 1950's the average age of marriage was 20 and 22 for women and men respectively.  This has risen to 28 and 30 in 2020.   In the 50's marriage was a stepping stone to adulthood.  In 2020, marriage is a "capstone".

The reasons for this are:

- decrease in religion
- increase in student debt
- increase in economic uncertainty
- increase in non-traditional partnership
- being vocal and ambitious about work is admired

In marriage we choose a partner for money, work, lifestyle, family, health, leisure, sex, retirement and death.

In your 20's it is important to think about marriage, the criteria and what a successful relationship is.

## Picking Your Family

> *Beauty is a greater recommendation than any introduction* — Aristotle

YAVIS: Young, Attractive, Verbal, Intelligent, Successful

Marriage is still about joining families.

- decisions affect the rest of your life
- be ambitious about love

Western culture is individualistic, independence and self-fulfilment.  Be:

- ambitious about work
- ambitious about relationships
- ambitious about picking your friends
- ambitious about picking your family (relationships)

## On Dating Down

> Conversation is to be thought of as creating a social world, just as causality generates a physical one — Rm Harré Psychologist

Be serious in relationships.  Don't let the "you" be a "dating down" version of you.   See, identity and respect your own personal value.

- We perceive our desirability by whether we <u>think</u> other people want us.  Perceived desirability equals perceived worth.   This is flawed!

High school leaves us with the most defining experiences and memories.

- in our 20's, as the brain (frontal lobe) develops we become capable of abstract thought
- in our 20's we need to start to form *<u>stories</u>* about who we are.  A coherent story which tells of facets of our identity.
  - easy: professional identities are easy
  - difficult: personal relationship stories.  Life stories can trap you.  Write them down, and work on changing them.   Understand and identify bad influencers and positive influencers.

## The Cohabitation Effect

> *Living together is not a good test for marriage*

Cohabitation is western culture is increasing over time:

- secular culture
- increase student loan debt
- economic uncertainty
- unemployment among young adults
- underemployment amount you adults
- availability of birth control

Effects of cohabitation:

- no science to show this helps a successful marriage
- how you choose to live together is more important then whether you live together:  Sliding and not deciding.
  - sliding: "It was just cheaper...", "We drifted into staying together...".  This is different criteria than if your are deciding with a thought towards commitment (standards)

Cohabitation after engagement:

- better communication
- high levels of committment
- greater marital stability
- explicit and matching levels of commitment, with thoughtful mutual decision making.  This leads to more satisfied and faithful relationships.

There is no "quick exit" from cohabitation.  It is not a low-cost, low-risk situation.  There are "lock-ins" as discussed in behavioural economics.

Behavioural economics:

- Once an investment is made, there is a decreased likelihood to search for other options r change to another opinion.  Set-up costs are the *entrance fee*, and switching costs are the time, money and effort to make a change.

- Be aware of the lock-in effect.  Routinely check-up on your rationale behind your decision to cohabitate.

## Being in Like

> *Regardless of conceptions of romantic love, the "one and only" typically lives within driving distance*

Being in like in relationships refers to:

- being alike in ways that matter
- liking who the other person is

Knowing whether you like someone comes from a range of experiences over time.  Travelling internationally with someone is a great place to see share these experiences; travel anxieties, delays, uncertainties, change.

We find relationships based on *assertive mating*:

- education
- age
- ethniticity
- religion
- attractiveness
- attitudes
- values
- intelligence

Assessing a mate over time has three major stages; sometimes rephrased as Lust->Love->Like:

1. Attraction
2. Kindness, Goodness
3. Compatibility

Psychology says that good partners are:

- emotionally stable
- agreeable
- conscientious
- open
- curious

## 29 Conversations

> *Love without conversations is impossible* —Mortimer Adler Philosopher

A partnership generally has two eras; before kids & after kids.  Partnerships and negotiation:

- foundational issues
- discuss what type of partner you would like to be
  - ask each other
  - ask yourself
- thoughtfulness conversations; takes times (have 1 of the following 29 conversations over a month)

### Conversations

1. Thoughts on marriage?

2. Do I make you a better person?

3. Are you religious?

4. How are we going to manage our money?

5. Do you want kids?

6. What do you think of our sex life?

7. Do we share the same political ideals?

8. What do you want your career to look like?

9. How traditional are you with regards to gender roles?

10. What kind of part do you want to be?

11. Who will do the cooking?

12. How to you like to keep house?

13. What standard of living do you imagine having?

14. What role will our extended family play in our lives?

15. How will we handle problems?

16. How will we keep our relationship alive over the long run?

17. What does our future look like?

18. Where do you want to live?

19. Why do you like me?

20. How important is travel to you?

21. How will spend your free time?

22. Have you ever cheated on a partner?

23. How do you feel about us doing things without each other?

24. Are you healthy?

25. What makes you happy?

26. What makes you feel loved?

27. What is a question I should be asking?

28. What is a question you would like to ask?

29. What do you need after a tough day?  What can I do to help you feel supported?

# The Brain and the Body

## Forward Thinking

> *Life can only be understood backward, but it must be lived forward* — Soren Kierkegaard Philosopher
>
> *The more you use your brain, the more brain you will have to use* — George A Dorsey Anthropologiest

Brain

- the front part of the brain (frontal lobe) defines how we act.
- An interesting story about a person named Phineas Gage, who in 1848, had a horrific accident where a steel pole went through the front part of his skull and brain.  Phineas survived, however his personality changed.
- brain development reflects the evolutionary areas of the human brain.   The brain develops from bottom to top, and from back to front.   
- Emotional Brain: The oldest parts of the brain are at the base of the brain (near the spine).  This part of the brain is the animal propensities, *the emotional brain*.  This part controls breathing, senses, emotions, sex, pleasure, sleep, hunger and thirst.

The frontal lobe is the most forward part of the brain.

- this is the most recent part of evolution
- *executive functioning center*
- logic & judgement
- cool rational thoughts; balance & regulate *hot* feelings and impulses of the emotional brain.
- high order thinking: anticipating risk, reasoned decision making.  Process probability and time (tackle uncertainty)
- conscious work of changing habits
- forward thinking
- think of future
- break abstract goal into concreate steps to reach it

Brain development timeline:

- 1 ½ years (18 months): brains first growth spurt.  Overproduction of neurons
- 20 years: Brain stops growing
- 20-30 years: frontal lobe finishes "wiring up"
- 100,000,000 neurons in brain.   1,000 connections/neuron

Smart: School smarts is not the same as thinking through life:

Smart in School is a measure of how you solve structured problems, and, how you arrive at correct answers in a specified time limit.  Life smarts, requires forward thinking.   Forward thinking involves:

- how you think and act in uncertain situations
- comes with age
- comes with practice and experience

The brain:

- can recover
- has plasticity
- responds to environment and experience

Wiring Up in 20's:  The 20's is a time of great risk and great opportunity.   You should use your brain in your 20's.

- jobs
- experiences
- best chance to acquire new skills is in your 20's
- we wire up what we hear and see.

## A Social Experiment = Social Media

screen time:  Life is better without the *compare and despair* impacts of social media.

time is important:  How you think about your time mattes!  How you use your time matters!

Studies have shown that lowering your screen time:

- leads to increase sleep, a more rested and happier self
- increased attention and focus, a more engaged self
- increased time for things which make you happier and healthier

Be extroverted with people:

- watch movies together, stage a talent show
- stargaze
- attend lectures
- book clubs
- fashion shows
- tutor
- volunteer
- draw
- exercise

Shallow:  Internet:  shallow, click to next

Deep: Give a subject sustained attention

Anxiety:  Leading mental health issue of the 20's

- socially inadequate
- socially incompetent
- socially behind
- nervous & self-conscious with people

Recommendations:  Time Matters!

- track recreational screen time
- take time away from phones
- think your OWN thoughts
- take 5-minute breask

## Calm Yourself

> *When we are trying to do something new, we don't kow what we are doing..   That is the biggest challenge.* — BJeffrey Kalmikoff Designer

The office is a different culture from school.  There is no freshman class or cohort you can huddle around with.

- you must work awhile before being thanked or promoted
- dress code
- typos matter
- sick days matter
- low confidence since doing *underemployed* roles

20's are full of "flash bulb" memories, that remain vivid throughout life:

- emotional or ununusual events
- 20's people take these memories hard naturally
- this is a "System 1" reaction to odd events (remember them).  (Note: System 1 is from *Think Fast, Think Slow* about the intuitive and rational thinking.  System 1 is the quick intuitive thinking.  System 2 is the rational part)

## 20's Brain

> *The art of the wise is knowing what to overlook* — William James Psychologist

William James, the father of psychology in the US, once said, “The art of being wise is knowing what to overlook.” When we find ourselves in uncomfortable situations, learn to stop letting the untrue or irrational thoughts take over. If we do, will find ourselves living entirely different lives. We begin to filter out the lies, and focus on the positive, true information. Overtime, we react less strongly to interpersonal conflict, and, instead, just let it be.

In the 20's the frontal lobe is still wiring up.  

Older Adults: With age comes the "positivity effect":

- more interested in positive information
- brain acts less strongly to negative information
- less engaged with interpersonal conflict

Young Adults:

- find negative information, develop anxiety over negative information, focus on negative information
- find bad news more upsetting and memorable than positive news
- react to surprise and criticism
- risks:
  - sustained worrying
  - chronic negative state
  - anxious (short term)
  - depressed (long term)
- suppressing feelings:
  - stress on body
  - stress on brain
  - impairs memory

> * *You can control how you interpret situations and how you respond to them*.  Attitudes and reactions are the last of human freedoms. — Vikotr Frankl *Man's Search for Meaning* (Holocaust Survivor)

Change how you think/thought about difficult moments:

- irrational thinking: imagine the worst: this is irrational and catastrophic thinking
- rational thinking: understand realities, realize "the weather" will improve

Change how you feel:

- magnifying negative emotions versus calm yourself down
- Borrowing an Ego:  Restring from "calling your mother" which is essentially letting someone else's frontal lobe (rational thinking) do the work

## Borrowing an Ego

- letting someone else's frontal lobe do the work
- calling mom
- if you "toss" distress too much like a hot potatoes we don't experience and learn how to handle bad days on our own.  We don't practice soothing ourselves when the brain is in the best position to learn new skills.   Without this ability (skill) our confidence is undermined.
- take responsibility: "own it"

Control over emotions:

- increases life satisfaction
- increases optimism
- increases purpose
- increases relationships with others

## Outside In

> *Knowledge is not skill.  Knowledge + 10,000 times is skill.*

Skill, repetition and experience leads to confidence.

- mistakes are feedback
- mistakes do not define you

Growth Mindset Theory, by Carol Dweck (see Theories).  Understanding, practicing and believing in a growth mindset is essential.

| Fixed Mindset                                                | Growth Mindset                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| intelligence, talents, etc are fixed in stone<br />fear you won't achieve your goals<br />restrain, only do tasks you know you will do well in | with effort, perseverance and drive you can develop natural qualities<br />experiences, training, effort can develop skills<br />use feedback and mistakes to improve<br />enjoy the journey of learning & becoming more productive |



## Confidence

Confidence:

- comes from the outside in
- comes when you can point to things you have done on the outside
- fake confidence "sutffing our self-doubt"
- empty confidence "platitudes"
- real confidence comes from mastery experience.  Actual lived moments of success.  Especially success in light of difficulty.
  - the confidence that overrides insecurity comes from experience.  Master over emotions (fear, ...) so you can have more mastery experiences

confidence = "with trust", trusting yourself to get the job done, repetition

Robust confidence which can survive failures can stem from jobs which:

- must be challenging
- must require some effort
- done without much help
- must have hurdles and obstacles

Job

- Frame & Hang accomplishments (diploma, ..)
- Dress Professionally
- Take credit for small successes
- No more self-deprecating stories

## Getting Along & Getting Ahead

> *A goal is a dream with a deadline* —Napolean Hill (author)

20's are the best time for change.  A person goes through a lot of personality changes in their 20's.   In your 30's your personality (thoughts, feelings, behaviours) do not change.

During your 20's; you:

- become more conscientious
- become more responsible
- become more socially competent
- feel more agreeable about life
- feel more confident
- feel less stress
- feel less angry

Social Investment Theory (see Theories for more information)

- becoming involved in world around us is how we grow
- committments to (love, work, world) trigger the personality maturation
- investing in adulthood leads us to feel better
- working towards these things makes us happer
- goals: make you happier & healthier

Setting goals leads to:

- greater purpose
- greater mastery
- greater agency
- greater well-being
- are the "*Building Blocks of Adult Personality*"

Commitments to other people

- fosters change
- fosters well-being

## Relationships

Relationships:

- reduce social anxiety
- reduce depression
- help us feel less lonely
- help us practice interpersonal skills
- help us learn to manager emotions
- help us learn conflict resolution
- source of security and support

## Every Body

> *I'm sorry.  It's true.  Having children really changes your view on these things.  We are born, we live for a brief instant, and we die.  Technology isn't changing it much at all. — Steve Jobs

> *Do not confuse feminism with being allowed to want a family.*— 1970's Nancy Chodorow

Older, educated parents are more stable, have more resources and are good for kids.

- However, do not be misled by the "availability heuristic".  Just because you remember a celebrity who had kids @ 40 does not reflect reality.  It is very rare to be able to have kids in your 40's (lower quality eggs, raised risk of miscarriage, older men's sperm has higher risk of genetic defects)

## Do The Math

> *To achieve great things, two things are needed: a plan, and not quite enough time.* — Leonard Bernstein Composer

The brain cannot keep track of time without markers.  Where did time go?  Confronted with mortality.

School is managed, orgnaized into semester chunks, microgoals, syllabi, assignments, tests.  

Visualize your future self and save & work towards it.    Avoid the *Present Bias*.

Present Bias: Prioritizing rewards and consequences of the here-and-now over the there-and-then.

- We would rather have $100 now then $150 in one-year.  (This is present bias.)
- Cake today, gym tomorrow
- new jeans today, credit card tomorrow
- difficult to give weight to things that happen in the future
- 20-somethings are especially prone to present bias
- memento mori (memories of death) verus memento vive (reminders you are going to live to your 30's, 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, ..)

**Be Future Oriented**: Construct timelines, and have a conscious thinking of the future to avoid abstraction.

- plan 5 years out (e.g., pass LSAT, attend law school, pass bar exam).  Take steps, read on how to goto law school.  
- plan a 5km run and the training
- plan internships
- work backwards:  write your future resume, biography and obituary

Choices and consequences.

There is no formula for a good life.  There is no right and wrong.

> __Am I going to make it?__
>
> *I don't know.  You haven't decided yet."

- The above is the question the author asks a park ranger upon a journey she was taking and she us uncertain about her abilities to make the trip within daylight and other factors.   The ranger's response is essentially the gist of this book, advising people to make decisions, and follow those decisions.



You are deciding your life right now:

1. Claim your adulthood
2. Be Intentional
3. Get to Work
4. Pick your Family
5. Do the Math
6. Make Your Own Certainty
7. Don't be defined by what you didn't know or didn't do.

# Theories

## Social Investment Theory

The [Social Investment Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_investment_theory) is a [psychological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology) theory that claims that changes in [personality traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_trait) over time are driven by changes in persons' commitments to social roles and institutions.  Since the late 1990s, there has been substantial scientific evidence that personality traits continue to change after childhood, especially during young adulthood. Generally, personality traits converge towards more [agreeableness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreeableness), [conscientiousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness), and [emotional stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equanimity).

## Trait Theory

In [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology), [**trait theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_theory) (also called **dispositional theory**) is an approach to the study of human [personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_psychology).  The [big five personality traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) are:

- [openness to experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness_to_experience) (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)
- [conscientiousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness) (efficient/organized vs. extravagant/careless)
- [extraversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion) (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)
- [agreeableness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreeableness) (friendly/compassionate vs. critical/rational)
- [neuroticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism) (sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident)

## Personality Trait - Five Factor Model

The [Big Five personality traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) is a suggested grouping of traits developed from the 1980s onward in psychological [trait theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_theory).   OCEAN / CANOE acronym.

- [openness to experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness_to_experience) (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)
- [conscientiousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness) (efficient/organized vs. extravagant/careless)
- [extraversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion) (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)
- [agreeableness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreeableness) (friendly/compassionate vs. critical/rational)
- [neuroticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism) (sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident)

## Theory of Emotion

[William James - Theory of Emotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James#Theory_of_emotion): In James's oft-cited example, it is not that we see a bear, fear it, and run; we see a bear and run; consequently, we fear the bear.  The theory holds that emotion is the mind's perception of physiological conditions that result from some stimulus.

### Mindset Work

[Carol Dweck - Psychologist at Standford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck) a research in motivation, personality and development.  She had an experience in grade school where doing better on an IQ test provided privileges.  She does not believe in IQ tests in having merit, but the motivation of doing well on the IQ test do obtain the privileges had a profound impact on her life and career.   Her book [Dweck, Carol S. *Mindset: The New Psychology of Success*. Ballantine Books trade pbk. ed. New York: Ballantine Books, 2008](https://worldcat.org/en/title/967222007)individuals can be placed on a continuum according to their implicit views of where ability comes from

- fixed mindset: success is based on innate ability
- growth mindset: believe their success is based on hard work, learning, training and doggedness.  intelligence can be developed (Kaizen)

> In a fixed mindset students believe their basic abilities, their intelligence, their talents, are just fixed traits. They have a certain amount and that's that, and then their goal becomes to look smart all the time and never look dumb. In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence. They don't necessarily think everyone's the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it.

This is important because

1. individuals with a "growth" theory are more likely to continue working hard despite setbacks and
2. individuals' theories of intelligence may be affected by subtle environmental cues

Mindset Theory is related to self-actualization.   

[Self-Actualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization#Abraham_Maslow's_concept_of_self-actualization) is part of [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs).   **Self-actualization**, in Maslow's hierarchy of needs, is the highest level of psychological development, where personal potential is fully realized after basic bodily and ego needs have been fulfilled.

The hierarchy from top-to-bottom is:

1. transcendences
2. self-actualization
3. aesthetic
4. cognitive
5. esteem
6. belonging and love
7. safety
8. physiological

Growth mindset practices:

- establish personal goals
- write letters
- write about and share with others something you used to be poor at, but are now good at.
- reflective journal writing

[^Choice-Paradox]: The Paradox of Choice theory  suggests that having too many options can actually decrease overall satisfaction and lead to decision paralysis. This idea is often attributed to the psychologist Barry Schwartz, who wrote a book on the topic called "The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less." In the book, Schwartz argues that having too many choices can lead to increased anxiety, regret, and frustration, especially when the choices are complex or involve significant trade-offs. He suggests that simplifying choices and limiting the number of options available can lead to greater satisfaction and well-being.
