# Part 1: Two Systems

## Systems 

| System 1                                                     | System 2                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| causal connections (sucks at statistical facts) - satisfying sense of causation (versus lack thereof in statistical sampling).  Not prone to doubt. |                                                              |
| Continuous assessment of main problems an organism must solve to survive. | Acquiescent Monitor                                          |
| Good at computing averages, but poorly with sums.  Example, Exxon, value of saving x, 10x, 100x birds all had same $100 value. | Deliberate Memory Search (Active Thinking)                   |
| Intensity Matching : converting emotion to $$, crime to punishment or sound intensity. | Complex computations, Comparisons, Planning and Choice       |
|                                                              | Self-Criticism                                               |
|                                                              | Attitudes (apologist - not a critic, endorser - not an enforcer).  Search for information and arguments is constrained to information that is consistent with existing beliefs. "undemanding" |

# Part 2: Heuristics and Biases

## The Law of Small Numbers 

## Anchors

Two different mechanisms produce anchoring effects:

- System 1:Occurs by a priming effect, an automatic manifestation. The concept of suggestion is a priming effect; which selectively evokes compatible evidence.

- System 2: A deliberate process of adjustment, starting from the anchor.  

Priming research indicates that our thoughts and our behaviour are influenced (much more than we know or want) by the environment of the moment.

## Science of Availability

Availability Heuristic: 1971 definition: the process of judging frequency by "the ease with which instances come to mind."

Unknowns in 1971:

- is this heuristic a deliberate problem-solving strategy, or, an automatic operation?   Answer: both systems are involved.

Availability heuristic, a heuristic of judgment, substitutes one question for another.   How the heuristic leads to biases can be discovered by listing the factors other than frequency that make it easy to come up with instances.  Each factor is a potential source of bias; the availability bias.

- Scandals among politicians attracts your attention.  Similarly sex-scandals among celebrities attracts attention.  Therefore you are likely to exaggerate the frequency of celebrity divorces and political sex scandals.  Factor = salient event.
- Other factors: dramatic event, personal experiences.
- Why one spouse feels their personal contribution to keeping a place tidy is higher.  "Availability Bias".  Spouses also over-estimate their contribution to cause quarrels (i.e., the bias is not always self-serving)
- Why a member of a collaboration effort on a team feels they contributed more.

Ease with which instances come to mind is a System 1 heuristic.

A focus on content is a System 2 heuristic (which replaces System 1 when more engaged) 

- People who let themselves by guided by System 1 are more strongly susceptible to availability bias (compared to those in a higher state of vigilance using System 2).  These people "go with the flow" and are affected by "ease of retrieval" more than by the content they retrieved.   This can be influenced (i.e., it is not constant for a person):
  - being engaged in an effortful task
  - in a good mmood
  - score low on a depression scale 
  - are knowledgeable novices on a topic (in contrast to true experts)
  - score high on a scale of faith in intuition 
  - if they are (or feel) powerful

## Availability, Emotion and Risk

Our expectations about the frequency of events are distorted by the prevalence and emotional intensity of the messages to which we are exposed.  

affect heuristic: People make judgments and decisions by consulting their emotions.  Do I like it?  Do I hate it?  The affect heuristic is a substitution form where an easier question (like / hate) is used to answer a much harder question.   The affect heuristic simplifies our lives by creating a world that is much tidier than reality.

availability cascade: [^sunstein] Availability is a self-sustaining chain of events.  (media report of a minor event, to public panic, to large-scale government action.)

### Risk

| Sunstein                                                     | Slovic                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Availability Cascades: distort priorities in the allocation of public resources | affect heuristic                                             |
| Proposes mechanism to isolte dcision makers from public pressures.  Allowing the allocation of resources to be based on impartial experts who have a view of all risks and the resources available to reduce them | Less trust in the experts and more trust with the public.   Believes the public would reject policies form isolated/insulated experts (insulated from the public emotions) — an impossible situation in a democracy. |
|                                                              | Policy makers must endeavor to protect the public from fear<sub>emotion</sub> (not only real dangers) |
|                                                              | Public resistant to decisions made by unelected or unaccountable experts. |

## Representativeness & Logic

The conflict between the intuition of representativeness and the logic of probabliy.

- Example: Describing a person as active in the feminist movement, and then asking are they more likely to be a bank teller, or, a bank teller who is active in the feminist movement.   The later is a subset of bank teller and therefore less likely, but many choose this.   Representativeness beats logic.

## Less is More 

- People incorrectly provide more value to a set of {10 valuable things}, than to a set of { 10 valuable things, and 3 invaluable things }.   Less is more.  The lower valued items affect the value of the whole.  Hence, less is more.

## Causes Trump Statistics

The concept is that people are inheritently bad at statistics.  The concept of statistics is quickly lost on people (even statisticians).  People want to have a plausible story and find cause (causal mindset).

> "We can't assume that they will really learn anything from mere statistics.  Let's show them one or two representative individual cases to influence their System 1."

## Regression to the Mean

The concept of luck and unluck creates the outliers.  In their next attemp (venture companies next year, businesses next year, golfers 2nd day, fight pilots next training session) the ones who did poor will do better, and the ones that did amazing will do worse.  

Two statements say the same thing, but one evokes interest and emotion and curiosity, and the later intuitively makes sense (is obviously true and not interesting at all). 

> a) Highly intelligent women tend to marry men who are less intelligent.
>
> b) The correlation between intelligence scores of spouses is less than perfect.

- [correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_coefficient): A **correlation coefficient** is a [numerical measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_measure) of some type of [correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence), meaning a statistical relationship between two [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)).

> Depressed children treated with an energy drink improve significantly over a three-month period.

- A set of depressed children will naturally improve over time.  The study would need to be compared to a control group.  The control group is expected to improve with regression alone.  The aim of the experiment is to determine whether the treated partiens improve more than the regression can explain.

Speaking of Regression to Mediocricity.

> "Perhaps his second interview was less impressive than the first because he was afraid of disappointing us, but more likely it was his first that was unusually good."

## Taming Intuitive Predictions

Address the concept that people who see one good trait, extrapolate that trait to other traits (or vice versa) when there is likely no correlation to the traits.

- prediction matches evaluation.  The prediction of future is not distinguised from an evaluation of current evidence.  The example is a description of some with average (but good traits) {intelligent, self-confident, well-read, ...}; the study shows people judged these questions identical (the first is an evaluation/description, the second is a prediction):
  - 1) How much does the description impress you with respect to the candidate?
  - 2. What is the your estimate of the GPA that the student will obtain?

Another study, was the young 4 year old girl who was a precocious reader.  The question was what would her GPA be.   People's intuitive equates reading at a young age to a high-GPA; and ignore the many factors specific to reading-age and GPA.

- reading age = shared factors + factors specific to reading age = 100%
- GPA = shared factors + factors specific to GPS = 100%

What is the correlation coefficient between reading age and GPA?

### Procedure to Count the Biases of Discrete Prediction 

bias of discrete prediction: neglect of base rates and insensitivity to the quality of information.    Applies to predictions on a scale (e.g., GPA or revenue of a firm) and judging the probabilities of outcomes.

1. **baseline prediction**: if you knew nothing about the case at hand.  In a categorical case this is the base rate.  In a numerical case it is the average outcome of the category.
2. **intuitive prediction**:  what is the number that comes to your mind 
3. **intermediate prediction**: a number between the first tow  
4. **default**:  if there is no information use the baseline prediction. 
5. **use the intuitive prediction**:  this is the extreme case when you are completely confident in your initial prediction after a **critical review** of the evidence that supports it.
6. **correlation**: pick a place between the two as you weigh the doubt and the correlation between you intuitive judgment and the truth (i.e,. it is unlikely your intuitive is perfect)

# 3. Overconfidence

## Illusion of Understanding

Illusion of Understanding:  We often say "I knew the stock market would crash.".  This is false, and should be replaced with "I thought...."

- knew: we can know something only if it is both true and knowable.   You cannot conclusively show the stock market is going to crash.  Premonition and Illusion would be better words to use.

social costs of hindsight: once the someone changes their mind, they have a hard time remember why they believed the other point of view.  — *hindsight bias*

### Hindsight Bias

Hindsight bias is unkind to decision makes who act for others (physicians, financial advisors, third base-coaches, CEOs, social workers, diplomants, politicians).  

- People are prone to blame them for good decisions that turn out bad.
- People are prone to not credit them for successes that appear obvious after the fact.

Outcome bias: When the outcomes are bad, people blame others.  

Examples of hindsight bias:

- A bridge that was damaged when the city chose not to hire a monitor.  24% of one group, shown only the at-the-time evidence, thought the city should hire a monitor.  56% of a second group, who were informed that debris did block the river, but informed to not let hindsight distort their judgment, thought the city should have hired the monitor.
- 9/11 hindsight bias: July 10, 2001 George Tenet (director of CIA) knew of al-Qaeda planning a major attack, but only briefed the National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice.  Washington Post executive editor, Ben Bradlee, declared, "It seems to me elementary that if you've got the story that's going to dominate history you might as well go right to the president."

## recipes for success

System 1 wants the world to by tidy, simple and predictable, and coherent.  The illusion that one has understood the past feeds the illusion that one can predice and control the future.

- stronger CEO and firm success has a 0.3 coefficient of correlation

## Illusion of Vanity 

cognitive illusion: even though a past failure of a prediction is known, people still have confidence in using the same approach for similar predictions (example: measure cadets during an exercise and predicting who will be a leader).  The testers, accepted the fact intellectually that they did poorly.  But it had no impact on either their feelings or on subsequent actions/predictions.

illusion of skill:  the stock market industry.  Cognitive illusions are more stubborn than visual illusions. — *illusion of valid prediction*

## Illusions of Pundits 

Our ability to construct and believe choerent narratives of the past makes it difficult for us to accept the limits of our forecasting abilities.  (from *The Black Swan*)

Speaking of Illusory skill:

> "She has a coherent story that explains all she knows, and the coherence makers her feel good."

## Illusions vs Formulas

Simple statistics can outperform experts. 

- Orley Ashefelter used an algorithm using only three weather-related-features; average temperature, amount of rain at harvest-time and total rainfall to predict wine prices to an accuracy of 0.90.  
- Experts try to be clever, think outside the box, and consider complex combinations of features to make predictions.  Formulas and Statistics keep it simple
- See Meehl's book[^disturbing] which shows how statistics beats experts.

To maximize predictive accuracy, final decisions should be left to formulas; especially in low-validity environments.

## Hostility of Algorithms

- **algorithms**: mechanical, atomistic, additivity, cut and dry, artificial, unreal, arbitray, pedantic, ...   Paul Meehl.

- **clinic method**: dynamic, global, meaningful, holistic, subtle, sympathetic, patterned, deep, genuine, sensitive

It is improper and unethical to rely on intuitiv e judgments for important decisions if an algorithm is available that will make fewer mistakes — Meehl.

Steps: 

1. Select a few traits that are prerequisites for success in the position (technical proficiency, engaging personality, reliability, ..). Ideally the traits are independent.
1. You should be able to assess these traits by asking factual questions.  1..5 scale (very-weak...very-strong)
1. Collect information on each trait one at a time to avoid the halo effect 
1. Hire the candidate whose score is the highest.

Skill develops (like in firefighting, chess, reading):

- an environment that is sufficiently regular to be predictable
- an opportunity to learn these regularities through prolonged practice

Expertise is a collection of skills.

## Engine of Capitalism

Optimism bias.  The belief that we will succeed, and the ability to ignore past failures (even if personal failures)

Competition Neglect:  We tend to focus our optimism and wishful thinking on only part of the story.  (term created by ColinComerer and Dan Lovallo)

- we focus on our goal, and neglect relevant base rates (e.g., average rate of failure of restaurant startups) 
- we focus on what we can and will do, neglect plans and skills of others (competitors)
- we focus on what we know (and ignore what we don't know): Rumsfeld's *unknown unknowns*.

Overconfidence: Studies have shown CFO's forecasts are useless.  Social factors play a role, since a CFO could not offer a prediction and say this is +/- 30%.   Effects of high-optimism on decision is a mixed-blessing:

- benefit: reslience in the face of setbacks.  Optimistic style (defending one's self-image) - taking credit for successes and little blame for failure

### Premortem

Trying to train out over-optimism:  Use the Premortm.

premortem (Gary Klein):  Procedure of premortem:  When the organization has almost come to an important decision but has not formally committed itself, gather a group of individuals who know about the decision for a brief session.  The premise of the session is a short speech, "Imagine that we are a year into the ftuure.  We implemented the plan as it now exists.  The outcome was a disaster.  Please take 5 to 10 minutes to write a brief history of that disaster. " As a team converges on a decision (especially when a leader tips her hand) public doubts about the wisdom of the decision are gradually suppressed and eventually come to be treated as evidence of **flawed loyalty** to the team and leaders.  

The benefits of a premortem are:

- overcomes the groupthink that affects many teams once a decision appears to have been made
- unleashes imagination of knowledgeable individuals 

# 4. Choices

[Utility Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility) represents a single consumer's preference ordering over a choice set but is not comparable across consumers. This concept of utility is personal and based on choice rather than on pleasure received, and so is specified more rigorously than the original concept but makes it less useful (and controversial) for ethical decisions.

- [Concept of Utility - University of Minnesota](https://open.lib.umn.edu/principleseconomics/chapter/7-1-the-concept-of-utility/)

## Bernoulli's Theory

Based on the utility of wealth makes people more or less health.  Theory allows for diminishing returns as people are more wealth.

Problems with theory:

- ignores reference point.   Where people were or are referring from.  The example provided is two people who both have $5M, but yesterday one had $1M and the other had $9M.   One person is elated, the other despondent.  This affects their decision.

## Prospect Theory

Three principles that govern the value of outcomes. 

1. Neural Reference Point:  Evaluation is relative to a neutral reference point.   For financial outcomes the usual reference point is the status quo.  The water example, of three bowls of water, and place one hand in the cold bowl, the other in the hot.  Now place each hand the middle-bowl (luke warm) and it will feel warm/cold based on the reference point.
2. Diminishing Sensitivity: Applies to both sensory and changes in wealth.  $900 -> $1,000 is different than $100->$200.
3. Loss Aversion:  Losses loom larger than gains.   Loss aversion is the most significant contribution to economics from psychology.

![Loss Aversion Chart](https://github.com/Gajol/Eloquent-JavaScript/blob/main/Notes/2022-Sept/Hedonic-Framing-Loss-Aversion.jpg)

Benefits of Prospect Theory

Prospect Theory complicates the Bernoulli Thoery, but the complication has been proven to be useful:

- reference point
- aversion loss

Prospect Theory:

- fails to account for the experience.  Compare:
  1. A miniscule chance to win $1M
  1. 90% chance to win $10, and a 10% to win nothing
  1. 90% chance to win $1M, and a 10% chance to win nothing
  
  In all 3 cases you have a chance to win nothing.  The experience is different though.  In the first two, the lose is a non-event.  In the third, a loss is intensely disappointing.   
- fails to account for regret.   Account for how someone will feel if the outcome is negative.  The example, is a 90% to win $1M or $150,000 cash.  If you take the gamble, and lose, you are left with $0 and significant regret.

## The Endowment Effect

The [indifference curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indifference_curve): connects points on a graph representing different quantities of two goods, points between which a consumer is *indifferent*.   For example, salary and vacation-days.  However, the indifference curve does account for a reference point; where you currently are on the curve.

[endowment effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect):  [Richard Thaler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Thaler) coined term.   Once some owns something of perceived utility (unlike a good meant for exchange like cash), the value doubles.  The mug experiment.  *hey found that the amount participants required as compensation for the mug once their ownership of the mug had been established ("willingness to accept") was approximately twice as high as the amount they were willing to pay to acquire the mug ("willingness to pay").*

## Bad Events

Humans (and animals) have a mechanism to give priority to bad news.  For example, brief scary images (fractions of second) can be registered by the brain with actually being "seen".

- a single cockroach will ruin the appeal of a bowl of cherries, but
- a single cherry will not change the appeal of a bowl of cockroaches (Paul Rozin)

Bad information is processed more thoroughly than good.  

### Goals

Goals are reference points.  In golf, the reference point is "par".   Human nature and loss averion play a role in pro golf.  Study of putts show an 3.6% increase in success for par-putts versus birdie putts. The asymmetric intesity of motives to avoid losses and achieve gains. 

Animals and humans fight harder to prevent losses than to achieve gains.

### Loss Aversion & the Law

Snowstorm and local store raises prices of shovels.  Fair/Unfair?

Fairness:  A basic rule of fairness is that the exploitation of market power to impose losses on others is unacceptable.  The basic principle is that the existing wage, price or rent sets a reference point, which has the nature of an entitlement that must not be infringed.  It is considered unfair for the firm to impose losses on its customers or workers relative to the reference point, unless it must do so to protect its own entitlement.

Similarity we punish businesses for our perceived losses (buying at an unfair price), and, seldom reward generosity.  We have an asymmetry between losses and gains.

## The Fourfold Pattern

Fourfold: a gambling bet, where all four bets must be successful.

In decision making, apply weights to characteristics that will affect the decision.

certainty effect: outcomes that are almost certain are given less weight than their probability justifies.  Insurance industry and structured settlements take advantage of the certainty effect (settle before going to court).  Overweighting of small probabilities increases the attractiveness of both gambles and insurance policies.

- possibility effect: improbable outcomes are overwieghted

Allais's Paradox:  Choose an option in each of the below:

- 61% chance to win $520,000 or 63% chance to win $500,000
- 98% chance to win $520,000 or 100% chance to win $500,000

Most people choose the first and then the second option.  This violates the rules of rational choice. The paradox is that the second decision just added 37% to each choice (61+37 = 98), (63 + 37 = 100).   This should not have affected choice.  But the "certainty effect" came into play.

The fourfold patternn;

- people attach values to gains and losses (rather than to wealth)
- the weights that they assign to outcomes are different from probabilities

|                                        | Gains                                                        | Losses                                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| High Probability<br />Certainty Effect | 95% chacne to win $10,000<br />Fear of disappointment<br />Risk Averse<br />Accept unfavourable settlement | 95% chance to lose $10,000<br />Hope to avoid loss<br />Risk Seeking<br />Reject favorable settlement |
| Low Probabilty<br />Possibility Effect | 5% chance to win $10,000<br />Hope of large gain<br />Risk Seeking<br />Reject favorable settlement | 5% chance to lose $10,000<br />Fear of large loss<br />Risk Averse<br />Accept unfavourable settlement |

### Rare Events

Suicide bombers and lottery winners.

The probability of an unlikely event is likely to be overestimated when an alternative is not specified.

Fluency, vividness and the ease of imagining contribute to decision weights.

- a disease that kills 1,286 people out of 10,000 versus
- a disease that kills 24.14% of the population

The first appears more threatening than the second (although it is half as lethal)

### Risk Policies

Prospect Theory: sure gain, and sure loss.  

Decision (i): Choose Between:

- ​	A: sure gain of $240

- ​	B: 25% chance to gain $1,000 and 75% chance to gain nothing


Decision (ii): Choose Between:

- ​	C: sure loss of $750

- ​	D: 75% chance to lose $1,000 and 25% chance to lose nothing

People are risk-averse in the domain of gains, and risk-seeking in the domain of losses.  75% of people chose A & D.

This results in people )being risk averse for gains, and risk seeking for losses) willing to pay a premium to obtain a sure gain rather than face a gamble, and will to pay premium to avoid a sure loss.

- narrow framing: a sequence of simple decisions, considered separately 
- broad framing: a single comprehensive decision, with four options

Advice, attempt to see small gambles in their whole (and not in isolation).  Realize that taking many gambles that have positive expected outcomes, means you eventually come out ahead.  Do not let *loss aversion* prevent you from taking risk.   Use this advice under these qualifications:

1. gambles must be independent (like a coin toss) - multiple investments in the same stock sector would not be independent.
2. loss cannot be significant - you must be able to afford the loss.  The loss should not cause you to worry about your wealth, or, your economic future.
3. avoid long shots - it should not be applied to long shorts where the probability of winning is very small for each bet.

The combination of loss aversion and narrow framing is costly.  Instead, think like a trader; *You win a few, you lose a few.*

Examples:  

- Insurance risk policies.  Always take the highest deductible.  Never buy extended warranties.  
- A risk policy that aggregates decision is analogous to the outside view of planning problems.  The outside view shifts the focus from specifics of a current situation, to the statistics of outcomes of similar situations.   The outside view is a broad view (framing) for thinking about plans.  

### Keeping Score

For many (who are not very poor) money is about self-regard and achievement.  We keep score; we have mental accounting.

- two people have baseball tickets, one paid for theirs, the others got it for free.   The weather is bad.  Which one is most likely to go to the game?
- similar concept with stocks.  The price you paid, should be irrelevant to the price you sell it at.

[disposition effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposition_effect): The disposition effect is an anomaly discovered in behavioral finance. It relates to the tendency of investors to sell assets that have increased in value, while keeping assets that have dropped in value.  In 1979, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky traced the cause of the disposition effect to the so-called "prospect theory". The prospect theory proposes that when an individual is presented with two equal choices, one having possible gains and the other with possible losses, the individual is more likely to opt for the former choice even though both would yield the same economic result.   

- sunk costs fallacy: The decision to invest in a losing account when better investment choices are available.

regret: a sinking feeling, thoughts about the mistake once has made and the opportunities lost, by a tendency to kock oneself and wanting to undo the event and get a second chance 

- regret is generally stronger when there is an action.  Eventhough an inaction can have the same outcome, there is less regret (i.e., not switching to winning stock, vs switching to losing stock).  This extends to blackjack, more regret is felt if you say yes to a hit and lose, versus, saying no to hit, and losing.

- blame: generally assigned to those who habitually take unreasonable risks

### Reversals

Poignancy should not have a factor in a decision.  For example, the compensation award to someone shot a store in their neighbourhood that they visited by off-chance since their normal habitual store was closed.   When looked at together (joint evaluation), people agree that the store where the person was shot does not affect the compensation.  However, when separated (single evaluation), people award higher compensation to the poignant story (fluke that he went to that store).

- [preference reversals](https://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/decision-making/preference-reversals/): refer to the observation that there are systematic changes in people’s preference order between options.
  - The preference reversal phenomenon was first observed in the late 1960s and the early 1970s by Sarah Lichtenstein and Paul Slovic in a gambling context. They observed that if people are asked to choose between a relatively safe bet with a low payoff and a relatively risky bet with a high payoff, and if they are asked to indicate their selling prices if they were to sell these very lotteries, people’s choice ordering is systematically different from their price ordering. More specifically, people tend to state a preference for the safer bet but tend to state a higher selling price for the riskier one. Very soon, this finding was replicated several times.

### Categories

Judgements are placed within norms for which we have developed categories.  Judgments and preferences are coherent within categories but potentially incoherent when the objects that are evaluated belong to different categories. (apples or peaches, steak or stew, apples or steak)

evaluability hypothesis:  The number of entries has no value in single evaluation.   In joint evaluation it is evaluated (Christopher Hsee).  In single evaluation Dictionary A is more valuable to people, however, together Dictionary B is more valuable as it has more content.

- Dictionary A: 10,000 entries, condition (like new)
- Dictionary B: 20,000 entries, condition (cover torn, otherwise like new)

### Frames and Reality

Emotional Framing: Unjustified influences of formulation on beliefs and preferences.  These are the same choices:

- A: Would you accept a gamble that offers a 10% chance to win $95 and a 90% chance to lose $5?
- B: Would you pay $5 for a lottery ticket that offers a 10% chance to win $100 and a 90% chance to win nothing?

A bad outcome is acceptable if it is **framed** as the cost of a lottery ticket; versus described as losing a gamble.  Losses evoke stronger emotion.  B attracts more positive emotions.

Theatre Example

- A. A lady goes to theatre with $100 tickets, but upon arrival realizes she has lost tickets.  Will she buy tickets?
- B. A lady goes to theather without tickets, upon arrive, is told the prices have doubled to $200.

Mental account (which account the loss is coming from) and sunk-cost fallacy, show that the lady who forgot her tickets is less likely to attend the show.   The loss is associated to the cost of the show and the experience is no longer worth it.   On the other hand, the higher cost for the ticket is taken from a "general account" and usually insignificant to prevent her from attending.  — *Charge the loss to your mental account of 'general revenue' — you will feel better*

Car MIleage Example 

The [MPG Illusion - Science Magazine 2008 Richard Larrick and Jack Soll](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1154983).   The MPG framing is wrong. Two people, 

- one drives a 12mpg car. and switches to a 14mpg car.  Saves 119 gallons on 10,000miles/year.
- one drives a 30mpg car and switches to a 40mpg car.  Saving only 83 gallons.

# Two Selves

Decision Utility: 'Utility' in economics means wantability; decision utility.

Experience Utility: Pain and pleasure.  How much pain during a medical procedure?  How much enjoyment at a beach?  Pain scale (0..10 - no pain, to intolerable).  Shows difference between experiencing-self and remembering-self.

- Peak-end rule (pain at the end of procedure, leaves unpleasant memory and effects rating on total pain).  
- Duration neglect (length of procedure had no effect on ratings of total pain)

Decision-making is often made on the *remembering self* with neglect from the *experiencing self*.

Experience Well-Being: Use of Time:

- Author collected experience levels and noticed French women spend less time with the children, but are happy during that time compared to American women.  Author hypothesizes this is due to child care availability in France and less focus on driving kids to activities.
- Two aspects of experience well-being:  The well-being you experience as you live your life; and; the judgment you make when you evaluate your life.

Gallop World Poll, assess Experience Well-Being through the Cantril Self-Anchoring Striving Scale.  The Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index.  A 0..10 scale, 0 = worst possible life, 10 = best possible life.

- in 2011, at incomes above $75,000 in high-cost centres, the experience level no longer increases.  That is money does not buy further happiness.   Possible answers are higher-incomes are associated with a reduced ability to enjoy the small pleasures of life. 
- Life satisfaction is different from experience well-being.  Satisfaction can from from education (however in the USA the more educated you are, the more stressed you are in general)  Living with children increases life satisfaction (but increases stress and anger)

### Thinking about Life

A disposition of well-being is heritable (just like height and intelligence).

The goals people set for themselves are very important to what they do and how they fell about well-being.  You cannot discuss the concept of well-being without considering what people want(ed).

Focusing Illusion: *Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.*

# Conclusions

Thoughts of Future:

- Biases: What can be done about biases?  How can basic biases of overconfidence, extreme predictions and planning fallacy be controlled?  Recognize anchors, reframe problems, ...
- Training to avoid System 1 errors? recognize the signs that you are in a cognitive mindset, **slow down**, ask for System 2 reinforcement.
- Organizations:
  - Decision Stages: Frame the problem to be solved -> collect the relevant information leading to a decision -> reflect -> review.
  - Organization improvement comes from routinely looking for efficiency improvements at each of these stages.  Iteratively; constant quality control and agility.
- Decision Making: Much work to be done to create systemic training for the essential skill of conducting efficient meetings.
- Language: A richer languge is essential to aid in the skill of constructive criticism.
- There is a direct link to gossip at the watercooler to better decisions.

# Idioms

- Wisdom of Crowds: [Wisdom of Crowds - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wisdom-crowds.asp): Wisdom of crowds is the idea that [large groups of people](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/04/011404.asp) are collectively smarter than individual experts when it comes to problem-solving, decision-making, innovating, and predicting. The idea is that the viewpoint of an individual can inherently be biased, whereas taking the average knowledge of a crowd can result in eliminating the bias or noise to produce a clearer and more coherent result.

  The theory is often applied to financial markets to show why markets in some instances operate efficiently and other times, inefficiently. Market participants in the crowd need to be diverse and have an incentive for markets to function efficiently. See original book [^Wisdom]

# Principles

Principle of Independent Judgement :  Before an issue is discussed, all members of the committee should be asked to write a very brief summary of their position.  This procedure makes use of the value of the diversity of knowledge and opinion in the group.  The standard practice of open discussion gives too much weight to the opinions of those who speak early and assertively, causing others to line up behind them.  [ Part 1, Chapter 7 - A Machine for Jumping to Conclusions]

Law of Small Numbers: The law of small numbers is the bias of making generalizations from a small sample size. In truth, the smaller your sample size, the more likely you are to have extreme results.   People are not adequately sensitive to sample size.  Problem extends to small counties and small schools.[^smallschool]

## Biases of Judgment

- Overconfidence:  We fail to allow for the possiblity that evidence that should be critical to our judgment is missing.  Our beliefs depend mostly on the quality of the story.

- Framing Effects:  Presenting the same information differently can evoke different effects.  The odds of surviving are 90%.  The odds of dying are 10%.

- Base-Rate Neglect

- Heuristics and Biases Approach:  

- General Bias:  Favours certainty over doubt.

- Hindsight Bias: Once the someone changes their mind, they have a hard time remember why they believed the other point of view. They are no longer able to argue their original point of view. — *hindsight bias*

- Judgment of representativeness: Ignoring base rates and determining relation by representativeness (description of person being nerdy and guessing they are in engineering, when the base-rate of humanities is much higher).  Substitution is used, since the question of probability is more difficult than the question of similarity is easier.  People substitute the easier question to answer; invoking a mental shotgun.   Example, Moneyball where scouts (representativeness ; look & feel like an athlete) was replaced with statistics about past performance.

  - Confirmation Biases: The mother of all biases.


  - Hot hand Bias


  - Spotlight Effect: frequent disparities between the way we view our performance (and think others will view it) and the way it is actually seen by others


  - Bias Blind Spot: the tendency to recognize biases in other people, but not in ourselves


  - Clustering Illusion: the tendency to see "clusters" of data in a random sequence of data as non-random

  - Illusion of non-transparency: the tendency to overestimate the extent to which people telegraph their inner thoughts and emotions

## Terms

- [Anchoring Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)): The **anchoring effect** is a [cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) whereby an individual's decisions are influenced by a particular reference point or 'anchor'.   If you consider how much you should pay for a house, you will be influenced by the asking price.  [Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.185.4157.1124)

- Associative Coherence: A stimulus evokes a coherent and self-reinforcing pattern of reciprocal activation in associative memory. [Associative Processes in Intuitive Judgment - Kahneman](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.tics.2010.07.004). Consistent affect is a central element of associative coherence.

- [base rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate): statistics the rate of group. If 1% of the public were medical professionals, and 99% of the public were *not* medical professionals, then the base rate of medical professionals is 1%.
- Bayesian statistics.  18th century Thomas Bayes.  [Bayes Rule / Bayes Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) describes the [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) of an [event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(probability_theory)), based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.  Bayesian reasoning; a) anchor your judgment of the probability fo an outcome on a plausible base rate, b) question the diagnosticity of your evidence.
- bounded rationality:  the study of bounded rationality, or how people search for information and make decisions with limited resources. Hertwig[^Hertwig] has been a key contributor.
- Cognitive Ease (Part 1 - Chapter 5)
- coherence, plausibility and probability: easily confused by unwary (those not using System 2).  People want to substitute plausibility for probability.  In the absence of competing intuition (plausibility), logic prevails.
- conjunction fallacy: the conflict between intuition and logic.
- [diagnosticity](https://dictionary.apa.org/diagnosticity): the informational value of an interaction, event, or feedback for someone seeking self-knowledge. Information with high diagnosticity has clear implications for the [self-concept](https://dictionary.apa.org/self-concept), whereas information with low diagnosticity may be unclear, ambiguous, or inaccurate. 

- Halo Effect 
- Loss Aversion: Respond more strongly to losses than to gains (System 1)

- Naturalistic Decision Making (NDM): Study real people doing things that matter.   Opposite of this book which is focused on biases in heuristics and biases approach.  Gary Klein - Sources of Power : intuition in experienced professionals (Firefighters)

- [Planning Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy):  Basing plans while ignoring information you have from past experience.  Instead realistic plans should be provided. 
  - *The **planning fallacy** is a phenomenon in which predictions about how much time will be needed to complete a future task display an [optimism bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias) and underestimate the time needed. This phenomenon sometimes occurs regardless of the individual's knowledge that past tasks of a similar nature have taken longer to complete than generally planned.*

- Polymath: A polymath is an individual whose knowledge spans a substantial number of subjects, known to draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems.

- Probability Neglect: A basic limitation in the ability of our mind to deal with small risks.  We either ignore them, or give them too much weight.  Teorrists, daughter coming home late.
- Prospect Theory

- Regression to the mean:  

- Children's heights in relation to their parents.  Francis Galton (a polymath & cousin of Charles Darin)

- Research Techniques
- Sense of agency (subject sense of ..) 
- Sense of autonomy (subject sense of ..)

- Single-Issue Negotiations.  Example, when price is the only issue to be settled (like selling a house).  Initial anchor effect has a powerful effect.  Advice:  When the other party starts with an outrageous proposal (high price) do not make an equally outrageous counteroffer.  This creates a gap that will be difficult to bridge in further negotiations.   Instead, make a scene, storm out, or threaten to storm out.   Make it clear, to yourself (to break the anchor effect) and to the other side, that you will not continue the negotiation with that number on the table.  
  - *Any number of the table has had an anchoring effect on you, and if the stakes are high (buying a house) you should ask yourself to combat the effect*.

- Stereotyping: neutral word is psychology (bad word in culture).  There is a social norm against stereotyping, including the opposition to profiling.  This has been beneficial in creating a more civilized and more equal society.  However neglecting valid stereotypes inevitably results in suboptimal judgments.  The costs are worth paying to achieve a better society.
- Test of Understanding Psychology:  The test of learning psychology is whether your understanding of situations you encounter has changed, not whether you have learned a new fact.  There is a deep gap between our thinking about statistics and out thinking about individual cases.  It is better to learn psychology through individual cases, than by statistical means.
- Theoretical Ideas 
- WYSIATI: What you see is all there is.
