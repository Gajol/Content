# Tool 1: Empower Your Observer

See Chapter 2 "A Challenge Accepted"

Purpose:  To cultivate the ability to be still, calm, and present with ourselves and others. This capacity is the foundation of equanimity that helps us to become more present, centered, resourceful, and strategic. The observer self is also the basis for self-reflection and the ability to engage in intentional change.

Discussion:  Nonjudgmentally witness your thoughts, feelings and actions.   By being in the "observer" mode/capacity we are more likely to be in control of our thoughts, feelings and actions.   In the observer mode we are less likely to be controlled by people and circumstances outside ourselves.  As observer you notice what is detached from personal thoughts and feelings.

Practice:

1. When phone rings, let it ring and observe your reactions.   Observe what is going through your mind.
2. When in a challenging situation where you want to impulsively react and act and express thoughts and feelings, switch into observer mode.   Nurture (cultivate) patience and observe.   When you take action, after being in observer mode, your actions will be more thoughtful, strategic and mindful.
3. Take a few minutes to be alone when faced with an important choice, or when you notice your are in Judge mode.   Sit quietly, note your thinking, feelings and desires (wants) at the moment.  Allow yourself time to observe, by realizing it is not the time to act.   Simply observe and not.

# Tool 2: Use the Choice Map as a Guide

Purpose: To provide a visual summary and guide for noticing one’s Learner/Judger mindset as well as the questions, and the future, that each of these might lead to.

Discussion: This is a mindfulness visual too used to help you be aware of the types of questions you are asking, Learner or Judger.

## Choice Map

![choice-map-questions-adams](C:\Users\doug\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\Eloquent-JavaScript\Notes\2022-Sept\choice-map-questions-adams.jpg)

Practice:

1. Experiment take each path separately by asking either Judger or Learner questions about the situation and consider the results each might produce.    *Where am I right now? Am I in Judger? Where do I want to be? What is my ultimate goal in this situation? Which path will take me where I want to go?*

# Tools 3: Put the Power of Question to Work

See Chapter 2, “A Challenge Accepted”

This tool relates to using Internal and Interpersonal Questions.

## Internal Questions

Purpose: To become more aware of your Self-Qs and to increase the quantity and quality of your internal questions, the ones you ask yourself.

Discussion:  Realize that the questions you ask yourself drive your actions.  The example given is packing for a vacation, you walk to your closet and you ask What will the climate be like?, Do I need evening or casual clothers? What packs well?  How long will I be gone?  The questions you ask define what clothes you will pack on the vacation.  Increasing your awareness of the Self-Qs is simple and have a huge impact on the results you can achieve.

Practice:

The first turns your attention to discovering how prevalent internal questions are in your life. The second focuses on the types of questions you ask yourself and the kinds of experiences and results they produce.

- Practice 1: **Observing Questions**: When you get up tomorrow morning, do a little personal question research. Note what questions you’re asking yourself as you get dressed. Then, from time to time throughout the day, ask yourself what questions might be driving your behavior in that particular situation, both in terms of your own actions and in terms of your interactions with others. It may take some patient observing to recognize those behavior-generating questions, but stay with it until you are able to recognize the influential role that Self-Qs play in your life.

- Practice 2: **Observing First Response**: Notice your responses to situations that come up throughout the day. Is your first thought a statement (an answer), or is it a question? If your first thought is a statement, experiment with changing it into a question; notice how shifting from a statement to a question changes your mood, actions, or interactions. Notice any correlations between your statements or questions and the kinds of experiences and results they produce.

## Interpersonal Questions

Purpose: To become more aware of the questions you ask others and to be mindful of their possible impact. Secondly, to increase the quantity and quality of the questions you ask.

Discussion:  The importance of asking questions to:

- Gather information

- Create understanding and learning

- Search for and challenge assumptions

- Build, improve, and sustain relationships

- Clarify and confirm listening

- Stimulate creativity and innovation

- Resolve conflicts and create collaboration

- Set goals and create action plans

- Explore, discover, and create new possibilities

**Practice 1**: **Question to Response Ration**: Approximately what is the ratio of questions you ask compared to statements you make (your ask/ tell ratio)? Do your communications with others involve more telling than asking? In at least one conversation today, practice asking questions much more and telling or advising much less. What do you notice from this experiment?

**Practice 2**: **Question with Positive Difference**: Recall a time when a particular question made a positive difference in your personal or professional life. It could have been a question you asked yourself or one that someone asked you. What was the question? What was the result? And what was it about the question that made such a difference?

# Tool 4: Distinguish Learner and Judge Mindsets and Questions

Resources: The Choice Map, Learner/Judger Mindset Chart

Purpose:  To help us to distinguish between our Learner and Judger mindsets moment by moment and notice how each affects our thinking, actions, relationships, and results.

Discussion: Identify the kinds of questions you are asking and the impact on yourself, others and the situation.

## Learner/Judger Relationship

| Possibilities seen as limited     | Possibilities seen as unlimited  |
| Primary stance: protective        | Primary stance: curious          |

Practice:

1. Look at Judger and Learner questions and notice how the questions affect you physically, emotionally and intellectually.   Explore how each mindset affects how you interact with people around you.
   - Judger: fearful, deenergized, negative, tense, "blue"
   - Learner: energized, optimistic, open, hopeful, relaxed.  Encouraged to look for solutions and possibilities.

# Tool 5: Make Friends with Judger

Chapter 4 "We're All Recovering Judgers"

Purpose: To become more aware and accepting of Judger mindset in ourselves and others so that you can learn to just be with Judger rather than reacting to it.

Discussion: The more accepting and "friendly" we can be toward Judger, in ourselves and others, the more free we become to make the best choices in any situation.

Practice:

1. **Journal**:  Keep a journal and record times when you catch yourself or others as Judger.  Capture moods and sensations, too.
2. **Rubber Band**: Pinch yourself (or snap rubber band on wrist) whenever you notice yourself acting as a Judger.
3. **Act as Judger**:  In a neutral situation (listening to radio, watching Netflix, ...) act purposefully as Judger.  Be openly judgmental or critical of hair, style, voice quality, clothing.  
4. **Reward Awareness**:  When you recognize yourself or others acting as Judger, congratulate your observer self.  This gives you freedom to choose.

# Tool 6: Question Assumptions

Purpose: To avoid making mistakes and suffering unintended consequences based on false or incomplete information, both in your own thinking and in your interactions with other people at work and at home.

Discussion: How do you assess your own assumption's accuracy?  Assess the willingness to notice and examine your assumptions (takes courage!).  The *habit* of asking skilful questions helps uncover blind sports and discover new information, perspectives and possibilities.

Practice:

Think of a situation where you are stuck, frustrated or seeking change of different results.  Use these assumption-breaking asking questions, considering questions thoroughly and writing down responses.

- What assumptions am I making about myself?
- What assumptions am I making about others?
- What am I assuming from the past that may not be true now?
- What am I assuming about available resources?
- What am I assuming about what's impossible, or, what is possible?

# Tool 7: Take Advantage of Switching Questions

Chapter 6 "Switching Questions"

Purpose: To facilitate easier course corrections from the Judger path onto the Learner path.

Discussion: Questions that help you or others move from Judger to Learner.  These resuce, turnaround or course-correct a situation.

- Am I in Judger (Awareness)
- Is this what I want to be feeling/doing?
- Where would I rather be?   How can I get there?
- Is this working?  What are the facts?
- How else can I think about this?
- What assumptions am I making?
- What is the other person thinking, feeling and wanting?
- What humour cam I find in this situation?
- What's my choice or decision right now?

Practice:

1. Recall Successful Turnaround: Think about a difficult and frustrating situation that you managed to turn around.  What were the switching questions and why did they make a difference?
2. Practice:  Pick a current difficult situation and apply the ABCD Choice Process.

## ABCD Process

**A - Aware**:  Am I in Judger or Learner mode?

**B - Breathe**: Be comfortable in the silence.  Do I need to pause, step back and look at this situation more objectively.

**C - Curiosity**: What is happening here? What are the facts?  What am I missing or avoiding?

**D - Decide**:  What's my decision?  What's my choice?  This decision can be after careful thought and analysis.

# Tool 8: Build Learner Teams

Chapter 8 "Learner Teams and Judger Teams"

Purpose:

To learn about the benefits of applying Question Thinking and the Learner/Judger distinctions for teams as well as for organizations.

Discussion: Working on teams can be challenging and people often work in Judger modes (lack listening, push personal agenda, blame others, blame things).  Learner teams allow each participant to follow guidelines to suspend Judger mode and cooperate in Learner mode.  This has a positive effect on everyone's experience, productivity and results.

Practice:

1. **Survey People**:  Ask people if they have ever been on a Judger team, or a Learner team?  Ask them to describe their experience, collaboration, productivity and results.
2. **Share Choice Map**: Show the choice map and have a conversation about the effects of Learner and Judger mindsets.
3. **Generate Guidelines**: Ask team to generate guidelines on the Choice Map about how to communicate and collaborate during meetings.

# Tool 9: Create Breakthroughs with Q-Storming

Chapter 10 "Q-Storming to the Rescue"

Purpose: To empower *collaborative, creative, and strategic thinking* that can lead to breakthroughs and more successful results.

Discussion: Decision making, problem solving and strategic planning and innovation can benefit from using Q-Storming.   Generate as many questions as possible; with hopefully some questions opening new areas in thinking.   

- "*Questions open thinking.  Answers often close thinking down.*"

## Q-Storming Guidelines

- Questions should be 1st person singular or plural "I" and "We"
- Generate questions from Learner mindset and avoid Judger
- Questions are mostly open-ended, not closed
  - How can I?
  - How can We?

- Invite courageous and provocative questions, as well as "silly" and "dumb" ones.

# Tool 9: Ask the Top 12 Questions for Success

Chapter 9 "When the Magic Works"

Purpose: To offer a useful sequence of questions for individuals and teams so that they may think more comprehensively before making a change or embarking on a new direction.

Discussion: Use these top questions to help in situations.  

Practice: For a current situation, ask these top questions of yourself or with whom you are in a relationship with.

## 12 Questions for Success

1. What do I want?
2. What assumptions am I making?
3. What am I responsible for?
4. How else can I think about this?
5. What is the other person thinking, feeling, and wanting?
6. . What am I missing or avoiding?

7. What can I learn . . .from this person or situation?  from this mistake or failure? from this success?

8. What questions should I ask (myself and/or others?)

9. How can I turn this situation into a win-win one?

10. What is possible?

11. What are my choices?

12. What action steps make the most sense?

# Tool 11: Coaching Self and Others

Purpose: Focus on the benefits of teaching the methodology to clients while using that same methodology to guide them through resolving the issues and goals they’ve presented.

Discussion: What clients learn in these coaching sessions makes a difference for outcomes in their current situation even as they are gaining skills for the future, to self-coach and be more effective at whatever they do.

Practice:

1. Self-assess past coaching sessions. How could it have been affective?
2. Coach from Learner Mindset - Reset:  Coaches can be in Judger more.  Are you introducing the Choice Map in a Judger manner aiming to show how the other person is wrong or in Judger mode?   Coach from a "Learner" place and mindset.

# Tool 12: Leadership - The Power of Question Thinking

Purpose:  Highlight where Question Thinking can contribute to the development of an inquiring leader.  The methods, benefits, and outcomes of developing as an inquiring leader.

Discussion:  Good leaders create an intentional Learner culture.  Inquiring leadership is open-minded, curious and decisive.   Other postive attributes of Inquiring Leadership are:

- self-aware, self-reflecting

- committed to continuous development
- adaptive, creative
- comfortable with the unknown and "not knowing" and not having all the answers
- thinking collaboratively, lead strategically
- ask more and tell/advice less
- encourage engagement, motivation and commitment:   focus on successes (replay successes not the failures)
- promote and inspire trust, respect and loyalty

Practice:
