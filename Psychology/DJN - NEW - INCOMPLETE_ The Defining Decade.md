[*Jay, Meg. The Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter and How to Make the Most of Them Now. First revised trade paperback edition. New York: Twelve, 2021*](https://worldcat.org/en/title/1241709696).

# Summary

The author, [Meg Jay](https://megjay.com/about/), wrote this book to help people in their 20's.  The author identifies that changing world, expectations and pressures on people in their 20's and relates their concerns.   There is life guidance in terms being deliberate in your choices.   Meg's Ted Talk, [Why 30 is not the new 20](https://www.ted.com/talks/meg_jay_why_30_is_not_the_new_20), is famous for framing contemporary twentysomethings journey into adulthood.

The twenties are important for many reasons.  In their 20's: 

- 80% of person's defining moments occur
- A person's earning power is defined in the first 10 years of work
- Half the people get married 
- A person brain changes the most
- A person's personality changes the most 
- A person's social network is at its biggest
- A person experiences the most uncertain years

The 21st century (2000+) is the first generation where culture has changed from immediately leaving home, graduating, marrying and raising a family.    What does a modern twentysomething do with the time now between the childhood home and owning their own home (family, career, ...).  This culture change has largely occured due to women entering the workforce and birth control.   Existential questions cause anxiety:

- dWill I be successful?
- Will I be alone?
- Will I be loved?
- Will I be happy?
- Will my life have meaning?

The book discusses three main areas, Work, Life and Mind & Body.   Several tools (12 tools) are provided, as well as 12 useful "learning questions".   Homework [^Homework] is assigned on topics relating to the major areas.

The book ends with the author providing a story relating to anxiety about "Will Things Work out For Me".  She describes her starting on a hike in a national park and being worried about whether she would make it or not; and wondering if she should embark on the journey.  She asks the park ranger, "Am I going to make it?".  "I don't know, you have haven't decided yet" is the response.

## Identity Capital

> You can't think your way through life...the only way to figure out what to do is to do something.

- [Eric Erikson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Erikson), a psychologist in the 1950's coined the phrase [identity crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_crisis).   He was half-Jewish and half-German.   Uncertain about his vocation and his fit in society, Erik dropped out of school and began a lengthy period of roaming about Germany and Italy as a wandering artist with his childhood friend Peter Blos and others. For children from prominent German families, taking a "wandering year" was not uncommon.  
  - Erik Erikson is best known for his famous theory of psychosocial development and the concept of the [identity crisis](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-an-identity-crisis-2795948). His theories marked an important shift in thinking [on personality](https://www.verywellmind.com/facts-about-personality-2795436); instead of focusing simply on early childhood events, his psychosocial theory looks at how social influences contribute to our personalities throughout our entire lifespans.

Identity Capital

- our personal stock of personal assets
- how we add value to who we are
- what we have to show for how we spent our time
- the investments we made in ourselves

Crisis and capital go together.  Capital is accumulated bit-by-bit over time.   Explore & commit results in:

- higher self-esteem
- more perservering
- more realistic
- greater sense of self
- greater life satisfaction
- better stress management
- stronger reasoning & resistance to conformity

## Weak Ties  : The Strenght of Weak Ties

You close circle of friends (your urban tribe) represents your strong ties.   These people are supportive but not transformative.

- comfortable and familiar
- offer support, sympathy
- insular, detached

Weak ties,  on the other hand, allow us to move around.

- weak ties know things we do not
- weak ties offer something new
- weak ties bridge us to something new

Social Psychology  identifies that when you do something nice for some, you like them even more afterward.  This explains how engaging with weak ties to help you can often have them help you beyond what is expected.  Keys in engaging weak ties for assistance are:

- ask for a cearly defined and easily deliverable favour
- make yourself relevant, interesting
- do your homework

> He that hath once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than he whome you yourself have obliged â€” *Ben Franklin*

## The Unthought Known

Unthought knowns:

- the things we know about ourselves but forgot
- the dreams we lost sight of
- the truths we sense but don't say out loud
- we fear what the unthought knowns means we should do next. 

Paradox of Choice[^Choice-Paradox].  The example in the book is a study where two different booths with choices of jam were provided.   One booth had 18 choices and one had 6.

- most people went to the booth with 18 choices, but only 3% bought jam
- fewer people went to the booth with 6 flavours, but 30% bought jam\

Choice:   Making a choice leads to hard work, potential of failur and heart break.  If we make a choice, we could fail.  There are two ways to look at the outcome:

- Postively:  As a result of the choice, I have learned and I am better informed.
- Negatively: I failed.  This is the wrong way to look at the outcome.

On the other hand, if we do not choose, we only have negative outcomes:

- we are not safe, the consequences are just further away in time

[^Choice-Paradox]: The theory you are describing is known as the "paradox of choice." It suggests that having too many options can actually decrease overall satisfaction and lead to decision paralysis. This idea is often attributed to the psychologist Barry Schwartz, who wrote a book on the topic called "The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less." In the book, Schwartz argues that having too many choices can lead to increased anxiety, regret, and frustration, especially when the choices are complex or involve significant trade-offs. He suggests that simplifying choices and limiting the number of options available can lead to greater satisfaction and well-being.
