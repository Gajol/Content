## Benford's Law

A phenomenological law also called the first digit law, first digit phenomenon, or leading digit phenomenon. Benford's law states that in listings, tables of statistics, etc., the digit 1 tends to occur with probability ![âˆ¼30%](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/equations/BenfordsLaw/Inline1.svg), much greater than the expected 11.1% (i.e., one digit out of 9).  While Benford's law unquestionably applies to many situations in the real world, a satisfactory explanation has been given only recently through the work of Hill (1998).
