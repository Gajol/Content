Simple Workflow Management

Goal:  Create a short-term solution that provides key functionality.

| Feature                 | Platform           | Notes                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tasking                 | ServiceNow         | Every employee is assigned a task to complete their performance and evaluation review (PER). |
| Worklow                 | ServiceNow         | The PER tasking is tracked in a basic workflow to understand the current state of the employee's PER |
| Analytics               | ServiceNow         | Each workflow has metadata to allow for analytics based on organization structure (directorate, branch, supervisor). |
| Workflow Administration | ServiceNow         | HR employees can manage requests to create, delete, revoke, roll-back PER workflows.   Requests are received through ServiceNow self-administration portal (ServicePlus) |
| PER records management  | Productivity Tools | Individual PER records (PDF document) are manually stored in the corporate repository (manual Put-Away). |
|                         |                    |                                                              |



PER Template:  Template stored centrally and available to all employees.

Task: Every employee receives a task.  The task should describe the procedure (how to fulfil the task) and can also be a checklist.

Workflow: General workflow is in the following stages:

employee-supervisor stage:   tasks assigned to employee and their supervisor to complete the PER.  Upon completion the PER (a PDF document) is attached to the ServiceNow workflow.  

HR-talent-management stage:  HR TM reviews, approves and closes the tasking.  The attached PER is filed in the appropriate corporate repository.   The HR application is updated as appropriate the PER results (PER score).

# Creating Tasks

Concept:

Someone will provide one or more lists of all the employees to have PER reviews.   The list will include all the information needed to create the task.  This might include:

- employee:  name, id, email
- supervisor name:
- hr tm prime or group:

### Development Steps

- whiteboard & paper design of workflow
- servicenow stuff:
  1. extend task table for PER

Glide Functionality

- Create a JavaScript script that reads a CSV file and creates record in the "PER Task Table"

Workflow

From ServiceNow Tokyo onwards "Workflow is legacy" and the new product is "Flow Designer"

Challenge:

- Glide: How to read a local desktop file or server-side file
